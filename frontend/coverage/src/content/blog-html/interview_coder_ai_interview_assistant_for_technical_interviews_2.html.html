I remember sitting in a phone screen years ago, staring at a problem that looked simple until my brain suddenly decided to clock out. That was the moment I realized I needed a better way to prep, not more grinding, but smarter repetition and cleaner thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;In this guide, I pulled together the questions that actually show up, such as coding, system design, AI-related stuff, and the behavioral curveballs Anthropic likes to throw. I’ll walk you through how I’d answer them today, based on the same approach that helped me land at Amazon, Meta, and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;If you want reps that don’t feel like guessing in the dark, Interview Coder’s &lt;a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;AI Interview Assistant&lt;/a&gt; AI mock sessions actually push you the kind of tight feedback, quick corrections, and practice that sticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Anthropic’s interview isn’t some mythical quest; it’s a bunch of tight, back-to-back hoops where you’re expected to think fast and not melt. You’ll get a stack of fundamental questions, a 90-minute coding test that feels like someone hit “2× speed” on your brain, and a few technical rounds where every minute matters. Nothing fluffy. Just you, a timer, and whoever’s evaluating whether you can actually build things under pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Daily practice works better than a last-minute panic session. Think of it like going to the gym: 45–90 minutes, one timed problem, a quick review, and a short log of what you screwed up and what you fixed. Interview Query says most people who keep this rhythm actually feel prepared, not “manifesting success,” but genuinely ready.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;System design prep doesn’t need to be a 40-hour rabbit hole. Ten focused hours is enough to get dangerous in a good way. The folks who put in at least that much time scored way higher. No magic. Just showing up and actually doing the reps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;For the coding assessment: don’t try to build the Louvre on the first line of code. Get something passing. Then clean it up. Add edge cases. Submit often. That 90-minute window goes by faster than you think, and the people who choke are usually the ones who tried to write a masterpiece instead of something that works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Anthropic also cares about how you think about safety and culture, but not in a “tell us your favorite buzzword” kind of way. Come in with a few short, real stories. Think 90 seconds each. Write a quick two-minute safety memo you can hand over. Expect a recruiter call upfront that’s basically: “Do you actually care about this stuff, or are you saying what you think we want to hear?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Track your progress with numbers that don’t lie: your median solve time, how often you get stuck for more than 10 minutes, and whether those numbers trend down after a few weeks. If not, the problem isn’t the interview; it’s your practice plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Interview Coder’s &lt;a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;AI Interview Assistant&lt;/a&gt; helps here by hitting you with timed sessions that feel like the real thing, giving quick feedback on what you wrote, and keeping sessions logged so you can’t trick yourself into thinking you’re improving when you’re not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What's Anthropic's Interview Process for Software Engineers Like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mb-8"&gt;&lt;span data-media="image"&gt;[IMAGE 800x600]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Anthropic runs a pretty straightforward gauntlet, such as recruiter chat, a coding test, a handful of technical rounds, and a behavioral loop with folks from either Research or Applied. The whole thing leans practical. Expect a Python-heavy assignment and technical chats that check how you think about design, concurrency, and writing code that doesn’t collapse under load. Team placement comes later, and you don’t need to obsess over it upfront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What Happens In The Recruiter Call, And What Are They Evaluating?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Treat the recruiter call like a vibe check and a resume audit combined. Thirty minutes, tops. They ask about your recent work, why you’re even talking to Anthropic, and whether your head is in the right place for building careful systems. They’re not grading your life story; they’re listening to whether you speak clearly about your work and whether you’ve actually thought about why you want to be there. Skip the salary talk. Save the “timelines” chat for later. Use this call to figure out what the team does so your follow-up rounds aren’t a blindfolded sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;How Should You Approach The Coding Assessment?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;The coding test rewards people who write clean, correct code quickly, not folks who throw design patterns at the wall like confetti. Many candidates get a 90-minute assessment, sometimes a take-home, live one. It usually starts simple, then grows a second head halfway through. There’s a grader that will happily roast you if you miss a corner case. Start with the most miniature working version, write tests early, and upgrade your solution in steps. Run the grader constantly. Keep your environment clean, use a big monitor, and rely on Python’s standard library instead of reinventing anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What Do The Technical Interviews Test, And How Are They Structured?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Anthropic’s technical rounds aren’t trick shows. You’ll get algorithmic work plus at least one design-heavy conversation. They want to see how you reason, where you cut corners, how you protect against bad states, and whether you can keep things readable under pressure. Usually, you’ll have around three &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372907818_Surveying_the_Importance_of_Integrating_Technical_Interviews_into_Computer_Science_Curriculums_and_Increasing_Awareness_in_the_Academy" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;technical interviews&lt;/a&gt;, covering code and architecture. They’re looking for clear thought, clean abstractions, and honest explanations, not big speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;How Should You Show System Design Thinking For Anthropic?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Keep it real. If they ask for a chat service or a thread-aware endpoint, build the most miniature possible version that would actually ship. Call out weak points, failure modes, and the quick fixes you’d apply in the short term. Draw diagrams that show who owns what data and why. Use actual numbers, latency, throughput, whatever, instead of vague promises. Pragmatic beats overly academic every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;Why Do Communication And Humility Matter Here?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;They care as much about your habits as they do about your code. If you can narrate your thinking without turning it into a TED Talk, you’re in good shape. Say what assumptions you’re making. Call out weird cases before they hit you. “I’m not sure, here’s how I’d find out” is a stronger response than pretending to know everything. Anthropic likes teams that work like grown-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;Why Do Most Candidates Struggle, And How Does Interview Coder Help?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Most folks cram for problem sets until their brains turn into a pile of pattern-matching soup. It builds speed on tidy puzzles, but Anthropic’s specs are messy and half-baked on purpose. You need fast iteration, not memorization. That’s why tools like &lt;a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;Interview Coder&lt;/a&gt; help provide real-time feedback, hands-on practice, and the ability to rehearse the exact style of debugging and spec clarification Anthropic expects. It’s closer to a live pair session than a flashcard deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;How Should You Handle The Hiring Manager And Behavioral Conversations?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Bring receipts. Pick one project you can explain from start to finish. Show what went well, what tanked, and what you fixed next. Expect questions about AI safety, privacy, and how you’d reduce risk in real setups. Keep your answers grounded: “Here’s what we did, here’s what I’d tighten up next time.” Behavioral rounds are structured conversations, not therapy sessions or a recital of a task list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What Tactical Prep Improves Your Odds The Most?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Practice making sense of chaos. Write tiny specs, then extend them under a timer. Work with black-box tests. Build comfort with &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;Python’s standard library&lt;/a&gt;, generators, threading, and exception handling. Tighten your storytelling as short, sharp project summaries that show decisions, not fluff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;If the coding rounds feel like patching a small boat while someone hands you new requirements mid-sail, that’s the point. You’re judged on whether the boat still floats and whether you can explain your thinking while the water rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What Happens With Timing, Feedback, And Offers?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Things move fast, but not in a stress-you-out way. Interviews finish within a few weeks. Feedback is usually calm and honest. They don’t throw exploding offers at you, so you can actually think. That breathing room helps you compare teams without turning it into a panic decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Stick around for the next section, the part most candidates skip, because missing those details does more damage than any lack of LeetCode hours ever will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;Related Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul

text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;You’re about to see the real stuff Anthropic asks. No sugarcoating. No tech-bro poetry. Just the questions, what they’re actually trying to sniff out, and How To Answer without spiraling. Use this as a mental warm-up to avoid fumbling during the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;1. How Would You Sample A Random Row From A 100m+ Row Table Without Throttling The Database?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What These Tests&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Whether you’ve ever dealt with a massive table in the wild instead of tiny demo datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;How To Answer&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Talk about random ID jumps, handling gaps, retry logic, read replicas, and making sure you don’t trash prod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;Sample Answer&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Pick a random ID between min and max, query for the first row ≥ that ID, retry if you land on an empty section, run it off a read replica, slap rate guards on it, and filter anything sensitive before returning it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;2.

You need a plan that actually fits into your life and doesn’t require moving into a WeWork. Keep it light, repeatable, and brutally honest. Daily coding reps that actually build instinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;A fixed block for system design where you tighten up your trade-offs. A few stories where you show you’re the type of engineer who worries about safety even when no one’s looking. Timebox everything. Track what’s working. Run through the little rituals you’ll repeat on interview day so nothing blindsides you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;How Should You Schedule Practice To Get Steady Gains?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Think of practice like keeping your guitar in tune. Not heroic. Just maintenance. Do 45–90 minutes a day, split like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;One-time problem under interview pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Fifteen minutes studying a polished solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Fifteen minutes writing down one lesson you’ll actually use tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;For each problem, jot down four fields: time-to-solve, what tripped you, what pattern it belonged to, and the one fix you’ll test next time. After a few weeks, you’ll have a tight 40-item cheat sheet you can skim the morning of the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/p/ai-interview-trends-tech-hiring-2025" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;Interview Query&lt;/a&gt; said something similar in 2025, such as most folks who practice daily feel noticeably steadier in interviews. Shocker: showing up every day works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What’s A Compact Plan For System Design Prep?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Give it ten hours, no more. Because ten hours done right beats thirty hours of watching. YouTube diagrams go by at 1.25x speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Break it up like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Two hours on the core patterns you always forget once pressure hits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Three hours reading short case studies and pulling out the failure modes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Three hours sketching full designs and judging them against SLOs and a rough cost target.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Two hours doing timed mocks with someone who won’t sugarcoat your weak spots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Set concrete targets in every design. Stuff like “99.9% availability,” “p95 under 150ms,” “don’t blow the budget.” &lt;a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/p/ai-interview-trends-tech-hiring-2025" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;Interview Query&lt;/a&gt; also noted in 2025 that folks who put in ~10 hours do meaningfully better. Again, consistency beats heroic all-nighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What Habit Kills Your Prep Without You Noticing, And How Do You Fix It?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Grinding problem after problem alone feels productive. It’s not. You get faster at puzzle-solving and worse at dealing with fuzzy specs, real-world quirks, and the stuff engineers actually get paid to think through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Tools like &lt;a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;Interview Coder&lt;/a&gt; help because they basically act like a teammate who doesn’t get tired: on-demand &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222408325_The_effectiveness_of_pair_programming_A_meta-analysis" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;pair programming&lt;/a&gt;, signals when you’re stalling, and clear recordings of your decision flow. You iterate faster instead of flailing in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;How Do You Show Cultural Fit Without Sounding Like You Rehearsed In The Mirror?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Skip the values recital. Show decision habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Make three short stories about real trade-offs you had to make: the tension, the constraints, the safety call you made, and what happened after. Deliver each in under 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Make a little “safety memo” for yourself. A few bullets: the risk, the cheap mitigation you’d try first, and a small experiment that would tell you if the plan is working. Then, in the interview, ask a pointed question about their safety telemetry or their postmortem rhythm. That question says more about how you think than any speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What Should You Prep The Night Before So You’re Not Panicking On The Clock?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Build a tiny toolkit and practice it until it’s boring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;A simple file template with your usual imports and types&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;A local test harness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;One keyboard shortcut to run/format everything&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;A couple of ick profiling commands you know by muscle memory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Practice saying your assumptions before you type and doing a summary after your test run. Record yourself once. Check where the time leaks. Tighten a little each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What Metrics Actually Matter While You Prep?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Keep it simple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Median time to a correct solution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Percentage of problems where you drifted for more than ten minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="text-gray-300"&gt;Number of patterns you’ve actually added to your working memory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Track this over four weeks. Pick one goal. Something like: “Cut my median solve time by 25% without tanking correctness.” If you don’t measure real bottlenecks, you’ll just keep practicing the stuff you’re already good at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;What Resources And Micro-Habits Actually Speed Things Up?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Read from one solid system design book and one SRE/reliability book. One chapter a week. Two sentences of takeaways. Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Twice a week, do short katas on a specific technique, sliding windows, two-pointer patterns, concurrency primitives, whatever you keep messing up. Use spaced repetition for pattern recall, not for full problem text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;When you test failure scenarios, make them annoying on purpose, slow the CPU, introduce flaky network behavior, and write down how you’d respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white"&gt;How Do You Train For Ambiguity So You Don’t Freeze Mid-Interview?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Run “chaos interviews.” You’re in a mock, then someone changes the spec halfway through. Great, that’s the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Practice the response:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Restate the new constraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Propose the most minor possible adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;Outline how you’ll check if the adjustment works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;That’s it.

Nothing drains your brain faster than pretending you don’t need help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;If you want something that actually saves time instead of adding another chore to your life, tools like &lt;a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600"&gt;Interview Coder&lt;/a&gt; are basically the cheat code everyone wishes they had earlier. Real numbers, not hype, include 75% of users landed offers within three months, and prep time dropped by half. Quiet desktop tools, coding help, audio prompts, all the stuff that keeps you focused instead of spiraling. It won’t magically make you a genius overnight, but it does make the grind less stupid, which is usually all you need to get the “you’re hired” email finally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="relative z-10 py-16" data-download-section="true"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"&gt;&lt;section class="relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center mt-[6.25rem] lg:mt-[10rem] mx-5 rounded-[40px] text-white" id="download"&gt;&lt;div class="" style="opacity:0"&gt;&lt;div class="text-center max-w-4xl mx-auto"&gt;&lt;div class="" style="opacity:0;transform:scale(0.9)"&gt;&lt;div class="relative mx-auto w-[3.75rem] md:w-[4.375rem] lg:w-[5.625rem] h-[3.75rem] md:h-[4.375rem] lg:h-[5.625rem] mb-8 border-2 border-black rounded-2xl" style="box-shadow:0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25), inset 0 2px 4px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.55)"&gt;&lt;span data-media="image"&gt;[IMAGE 90x90]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-[black]/0 to-[black] rounded-2xl mix-blend-overlay pointer-events-none"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="" style="opacity:0;transform:translateY(20px)"&gt;&lt;h2 class="text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold mb-2 leading-tight text-white"&gt;Ready to Pass Any SWE Interviews with 100% Undetectable AI?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="" style="opacity:0;transform:translateY(20px)"&gt;&lt;p class="text-base lg:text-lg mb-8 lg:mb-11 max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed text-gray-300"&gt;Start Your Free Trial Today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="" style="opacity:0;transform:translateY(20px)"&gt;&lt;div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row justify-center items-center gap-4 max-w-[600px] mx-auto"&gt;&lt;div class="relative flex-1 min-w-[280px]"&gt;&lt;button class="group relative flex items-center justify-center gap-3 px-5 py-4 rounded-full text-base md:text-lg font-semibold w-full overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-[1.02] active:scale-[0.98] disabled:opacity-70 disabled:cursor-not-allowed whitespace-nowrap" aria-expanded="false"&gt;&lt;div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-[#EFCC3A] to-[#EFB63A]"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-white/30 via-white/10 to-transparent"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="absolute top-0 left-2 right-2 h-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-white/40 to-transparent rounded-full"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-[#F5D742] to-[#E5A83A] opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-300"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="relative z-10 flex items-center gap-3"&gt;&lt;span data-media="image"&gt;[IMAGE 18x18]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="text-black font-semibold tracking-tight"&gt;Pass Your Next Interview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="absolute inset-0 rounded-full shadow-xl shadow-[#EFCC3A]/30 group-hover:shadow-[#EFCC3A]/50 transition-shadow duration-300"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="group relative flex items-center justify-center gap-3 px-5 py-4 rounded-full text-base md:text-lg font-semibold w-full min-w-[280px] overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-[1.02] active:scale-[0.98] disabled:opacity-70 disabled:cursor-not-allowed whitespace-nowrap"&gt;&lt;div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-[#EFCC3A] to-[#EFB63A]"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-white/30 via-white/10 to-transparent"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="absolute top-0 left-2 right-2 h-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-white/40 to-transparent rounded-full"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-[#F5D742] to-[#E5A83A] opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-300"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="relative z-10 flex items-center gap-3"&gt;&lt;span data-media="image"&gt;[IMAGE 18x18]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="text-black font-semibold tracking-tight"&gt;Pass Your Next Interview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="absolute inset-0 rounded-full shadow-xl shadow-[#EFCC3A]/30 group-hover:shadow-[#EFCC3A]/50 transition-shadow duration-300"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-16 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"&gt;&lt;a class="inline-flex items-center px-6 py-3 bg-black text-white font-medium rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors" href="/blog"&gt;← Back to Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</pre></td></tr></table></pre>
