I learned that the hard way. My first real tech interview felt like a circus, such as a recruiter call on Monday, a whiteboard round on Wednesday, and behavioral questions on Friday that made me rethink my life choices.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re feeling the same, you’re not alone. Deloitte interviews can be confusing, coding here, system design there, and then a “Tell me about a time…” that hits you out of nowhere.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s why I built Interview Coder <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">AI Interview Assistant</a>. It provides focused practice on the material that actually appears in coding challenges, mock sessions with feedback, and clean behavioral templates that don’t sound scripted. You’ll walk in knowing what to expect, and more importantly, how to respond like someone who belongs there.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Summary</h2><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Deloitte interviews aren’t hard because the questions are impossible. They’re challenging because the format changes every round, and most people walk in guessing rather than knowing. You start with a recruiter chat (basically a vibe check), then get dumped into a 60-90 minute timed coding test where a single misclick can cost you the next round. After that? Live interviews that feel more like client demos than technical screens. You don’t just write code; you narrate every decision as if you’re pitching to the CTO.</li><li class="text-gray-300">The engineers who survive this? They’re the ones who’ve practiced explaining their code out loud. Not once. Dozens of times. They’ve shaved their brute force plan time from six minutes down to three, without nuking their correctness rate. They run through rubrics. They practice resetting calmly after bugs. They rehearse recovery as if it were part of the solution because it is.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Suppose you can’t explain your code while coding under pressure, with someone interrupting you, good luck. Deloitte prioritizes clarity over elegance. Can you state your assumptions? Run edge cases fast? Own it when things break?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Salary? Come prepared. They’ll ask. Use data. $95k median. $164k 90th percentile. Don’t pull numbers out of thin air, anchor to the market, and back it up.</li><li class="text-gray-300">And don’t wing your prep. Build a weekly rhythm. Think: two 1-hour Leetcode rounds (timed), one deep SQL schema sprint, a systems sketch or two, and mock interviews every other day. It’s not glamorous, but it works.</li><li class="text-gray-300">That’s where <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> fits in. You don’t need 20 PDFs or a mentor who ghosts you. Just queue up a timed mock, get real-time feedback, fix your blind spots, and stop choking when it counts.</li></ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What Is the Interview Process Like for a Software Engineer Role at Deloitte?</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I’ve seen many people mess this one up, not because they’re unqualified, but because they prepared for the wrong game. Deloitte doesn’t just care if you can code. They care if you can ship clean logic under pressure, sound like someone they can put in front of a client, and not flinch when a question goes sideways. If you're expecting LeetCode on autopilot, you'll get flattened.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s precisely how it works.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Online Application + Recruiter Screening</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What happens after you submit your resume? You send your resume to Deloitte’s portal, or get a referral, or meet someone on campus who tells you to apply. Either way, it hits a recruiter’s inbox. They’re not grading your side projects like it's Hacker News; they’re asking if this person can explain what they built. Can they survive a client meeting without melting?</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re lucky, you’ll get a fast email reply. If you’re not, it’ll be radio silence until a random Thursday at 2:17 pm when they ask for a 30-minute call. That call is where they check for two things:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Can you walk through what you’ve built without turning it into a TED talk?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Do your qualifications actually match what’s on your resume?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Heads up: If you're hiding anything (degree, work authorization, etc.), it'll surface later and not in a good way.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Online Assessment</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What does the test really look like? It’s timed. It’s proctored. It’s not the moment to open 27 tabs and Google “binary search in Python.” You’ll get 4–5 sections in a row: quick logic questions, some algorithm stuff, and multiple-choice on <a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/blog/the-basics-of-computer-science-how-to-get-started/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">CS basics</a>. Expect 60–90 minutes of non-stop pressure.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No one cares if you can outsmart the grader with a weird trick. They want clean code that works. Write it as if someone else will read it five minutes before a production deployment.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Technical Interviews</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">How do they evaluate you when you're live? Short and sharp. Typically, one or two rounds, each lasting 20–40 minutes. Real people, real code. They're watching:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">How do you break problems down</li><li class="text-gray-300">How you handle feedback</li><li class="text-gray-300">Whether you panic when they change the question mid-way</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re more senior, expect a mini systems design question. They're not looking for a genius diagram; they’re checking if you can think in terms of components, tradeoffs, and reality. Not fantasy diagrams. Mention latency if it matters. Mention tradeoffs if they’re real. And for the love of clean code, say what you’re thinking out loud.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Behavioral Interview</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Why does Deloitte ask these soft-skill questions? Because if they’re putting you in front of a client, they need to trust that you won’t say something weird or freeze. This round is where they figure out:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Can you collaborate when the stakes are high?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Can you communicate when the pressure is at its worst?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Can you make a decision and own it?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’ll get scenario-based questions. Use real stories. Don’t make them up. Be honest about your thinking process. They care more about your judgment than your title.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Offer + Negotiation</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What do they pay, and what should you say when the number drops? If you complete all of that, Talent Acquisition will send a compensation package. Usually includes base, bonus targets, and benefits. Sometimes, equity is determined by the location of the office.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">To keep it real:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Median base $95K</li><li class="text-gray-300">Top-end base $164K</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">(<a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-guides/deloitte-software-engineer" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Query 2023</a>)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use that to set your anchor during negotiation. Ask about promotion timelines. Ask about performance bands. You only get one shot before you're locked in.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Prep That Actually Works</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What should you really be doing to prep? Most people grind LeetCode. They think doing 1,000 problems means they’re ready. Nope.That’s like preparing for a boxing match by shadowboxing in front of a mirror.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What actually works:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Simulate the test timed sessions, no tabs, no notes</li><li class="text-gray-300">Practice saying your code out loud. It’s awkward at first, but necessary</li><li class="text-gray-300">Know your projects you’ll get asked about, be ready</li><li class="text-gray-300">Be upfront if you’re missing something, such as a degree or relevant experience. Say it. Gaps in experience? Own it.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s way better than trying to sneak it past them and sweating bullets in Round 3.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What Breaks People (That You Can Avoid)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Where do strong candidates actually lose the offer?</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">They ghost recruiters.</li><li class="text-gray-300">They wait too long to clarify work eligibility.</li><li class="text-gray-300">They collapse during the proctored test because they never practiced under pressure.</li><li class="text-gray-300">They try to be someone they’re not during behavioral rounds and come across as awkward.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Additionally, silence is often observed after interviews. It doesn’t always mean rejection. But don’t just sit there, send a clean follow-up and ask about next steps. No begging. Just professional check-ins.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Quick Analogy So You Don’t Forget This Flow</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Think of the process like shipping a feature:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Resume Spec</li><li class="text-gray-300">Assessment Unit + Integration Tests</li><li class="text-gray-300">Technical Rounds End-to-End</li><li class="text-gray-300">Behavioral Will This Actually Ship Without Blowing Up?</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Still Curious?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">All of that is the structure, but what are the actual questions that decide who gets the offer?</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let’s talk about those next.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Related Reading</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><a

data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I’ve seen too many brilliant engineers walk into a Deloitte interview and blow it, not because they didn’t know how to code, but because they couldn’t explain what they were doing. Deloitte interviews aren’t about fancy algorithms. They’re about how you think, how you talk, and how you’d sound in front of a client who barely knows what an array is.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I built <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> because I was tired of watching great developers fail for trivial reasons. I used it to land internships at Amazon, Meta, and TikTok. This isn’t theory. These are the questions that keep resurfacing. I’ll tell you what they’re really looking for, and how I’d answer them under pressure.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let’s get into it.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This isn’t a “grind more LeetCode” post. Deloitte wants clear thinkers who can code, explain, and make tradeoffs like grown-ups. Below are 31 common questions with real framing, not fluff.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. Given A Dictionary With Weights, Write A Function That Returns A Key At Random With A Probability Proportional To The Weights</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Is your math stable? Do you know the tradeoffs?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“I’d build a prefix-sum array of weights, then use binary search to pick a value based on a random float. That gives me O(n) setup, O(log n) per pick. I’d test for negative weights or zero-sum inputs and handle those with early checks.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. Write A Query To Get The Average Commute Time For Each Commuter In New York.</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can you turn messy business logic into <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/structured-query-language" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Structured Query Language (SQL)</a> that works?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Assuming we’ve got start and end timestamps, I’d use TIMESTAMPDIFF or subtraction, group by commuter ID, and make sure to handle NULLs and missing entries cleanly. Also worth pointing out where indexes matter if the dataset’s big.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. Write a Python Function max_profit For Stock Prices To Return The Maximum Profit With Up To Two Transactions.</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Do you know how to track state across passes?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“I’d go with the classic four-variable trick: buy1, profit1, buy2, profit2. Walk prices from left to right, updating those vars. Time is O(n), space is O(1). Easy to test with a decreasing list to make sure it handles zero-profit cases.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. Normalize Test Grades To A 0–1 Linear Scale</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Will your code explode when inputs are weird?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Find min and max. If they’re equal, return all 1s or 0s depending on the policy. Otherwise, (x - min) / (max - min) for each grade. I’d use list comp or NumPy for that, and mention how I round the result.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. Identify Top Users Likely To Be Friends With A Specific User Based On Weighted Signals.</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can you rank stuff based on product logic?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“I’d list the signal types mutual friends, follows, likes, assign weights, and filter out people already connected or blocked. I’d build it in SQL or a graph query and explain the scoring function clearly, especially for PMs.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. Calculate The 3-Day Rolling Average Of Steps For Each User</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Do you understand windowing?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Use a window function with ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW. If dates are sparse, I’d build a date spine or self-join instead. Bonus: round to 1 decimal and mention what happens when there are fewer than 3 days.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. Design A Notification System For A Social Media Platform</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Will this system fall over when someone goes viral?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“I’d sketch out events, queues, and notification tables. Push vs. pull logic depends on scale and latency. I’d cache for high-traffic users, dedupe aggressively, and monitor for fan-out failures.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. Design The Database And Engineering System For A Dynamic Real-Time Sales Dashboard.</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can you keep up with real-time demands without blowing the budget?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Event ingestion → processing (e.g., Flink/Spark) → serving layer (Redis, materialized view). I’d call out exactly how I’d test correctness under sudden spikes or data delays.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. Design A Database Schema For A Yelp-Like System</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can you design for scale, reads, and write constraints?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“I’d show core tables users, businesses, reviews, normalize where needed, but denormalize for reads.

Enforce 1 review per user per business. Cache top-rated stuff.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Table Schema To Track Car Enter And Exit Times On A Bridge</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can you keep time-based events sane?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Track events in a table with timestamps. Use joins to pair entry and exit. Handle open sessions (no exit event), maybe with a TTL or flag. I’d partition by date if this is high volume.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. Model A Database For An Airline Company</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Listening For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can your schema support real queries?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Flights, legs, aircraft, airports, routes. I’d model legs as separate rows under a flight ID. Shortest path? I’d mention precomputed routes or Dijkstra over the graph if needed.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12.

What Is A Microservices Architecture?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Please don’t just say “it’s about small, independently deployable services.” They’ve heard that a hundred times. Demonstrate to them how that translates into practical application.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Try This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Say we’ve got a monolith with auth, payments, and reporting. First thing I’d pull out? Auth. Why? It changes often and has a clean boundary. I’d give it its own repo, CI pipeline, and container. Then I’d deal with communication (probably gRPC), and make sure we log and trace everything so debugging isn’t a guessing game.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">33. Difference Between Monolithic And Microservices Architectures?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is a trap question if you make it a religious issue.

How To Achieve Fault Tolerance In Distributed Systems?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The honest answer isn’t “retry logic” or “circuit breaker.”</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Better</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Here’s what I’d build: load balancers, retries with backoff, circuit breakers with alerts, and fallback paths that don’t throw 500s. Example? We had a US-East region failover, which kicked in to US-West within seconds. No one paged. That’s what I call a win.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">35. Role of Docker and Kubernetes?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you say “Kubernetes helps you scale,” stop. That’s not an answer. That’s an ad.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Try This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We used Docker to get identical environments between dev and prod. Kubernetes handled pod scheduling, restarts, and rollout strategies. CI pipeline? Dockerized tests. Prod? Canary deploys with liveness/readiness probes.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">36. How Do You Scale A Cloud-Based Application?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Scaling isn’t magic. It’s trade-offs.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Try This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Horizontal scale via stateless services and load balancers. For storage, we cache (Redis) and shard the DB once writes get heavy. Autoscaling groups handle spikes, but we also run capacity tests weekly to catch issues before users do.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">37. What Are Design Patterns?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you just list them, they’ll tune out.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Stronger</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Patterns are mental shortcuts. Factory when object creation is messy, Adapter when APIs don’t match, Observer for pub-sub, Leader Election in distributed systems. But patterns aren’t Pokemon don’t collect them just to show off. Use them when they clean up real messes.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">38. SOLID Principles in OOP?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No one wants an acronym recital.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Instead</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Single Responsibility: broke a bloated UserManager into AuthHandler and ProfileService less bugs.

What is SOA?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This one’s not a trick; they just want to know you’ve seen both sides.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“SOA is like microservices' older cousin fewer, larger services with a central governance layer. More shared contracts, more bureaucracy. We used SOA at my last job because legal needed consistent audit logs across apps. Microservices? Better for fast-moving teams.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">40. How To Version Software And Dependencies?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say this</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Semantic versioning. Pin dependencies, avoid implicit upgrades. APIs remain backward-compatible for two versions, then they are deprecated. CI catches breaking changes. Registry auto-publishes release notes. Consumers don’t wake up to surprises.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">41.

Symmetric Vs. Asymmetric Encryption?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Symmetric is one key fast, used for data storage. Asymmetric cryptography is used in TLS and for identity verification. We often use hybrid: asymmetric for handshake, symmetric for the session.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">46.

Explain why.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say this</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“HANA runs everything in-memory, so reads are nearly instant. It handles both transactions and analytics within a single engine. We replaced our old ETL pipeline with live dashboards directly on HANA. More RAM costs, but way less batch-job pain.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">55. How Do You Attack an SAP System Integration?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This isn’t about hacking; it’s about not turning Go-Live into a disaster.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Here’s How To Frame It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Start by mapping out interfaces what’s pushing data where.

What’s ABAP And Where Does It Fit?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ABAP isn’t exciting, but it’s still everywhere.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Here’s How To Say It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ABAP is the scripting layer for SAP. We use it to build reports, tweak business logic, and handle batch processing. When off-the-shelf config won’t cut it, we write ABAP. But we test it like regular code unit tests, transports, and review before prod.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">59. How Do You Run A Clean Data Migration In SAP?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Migrations suck when rushed. This one’s about process, not tools.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Like This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We started with mapping old vs new fields. Cleaned junk data early. Ran dry migrations with reconciliation reports. Used Migration Cockpit for small stuff, Data Services for the hairy parts. Final go-live had rollback plans and signoff checklists.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">60. How To Integrate SAP with Non-SAP Systems?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You don’t want to duct-tape this. The goal is clean handoffs.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We used OData for real-time calls, REST for lighter touch, and events where we needed async. Middleware handled retries and mapping. Always built with idempotency in mind, so if it gets called twice, it doesn’t break the world.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">61. What is SAP BusinessObjects, And How Is It Used For Reporting?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">BusinessObjects is SAP’s answer to “hey, can I see that in a report?”</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“It’s the reporting layer for business users. Think dashboards, paginated reports, and ad hoc queries all pointing at SAP or other databases. We used it to build self-service dashboards for execs so they didn’t ping the data team every morning.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">62. How Do You Design A CI/CD Pipeline?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No buzzwords, they want to know you’ve built one.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Here’s The Playbook</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Code pushed to Git kicks off build → unit tests → artifact pushed to registry → staging deploy → integration tests → manual approval → prod. Add rollback, health checks, and alerting. No deploy should feel like crossing fingers.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">63. What Are The Benefits of DevOps?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This one’s an eye-roll unless you keep it real.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Try This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We shipped twice as fast once we stopped throwing code over the wall. DevOps meant fewer bugs, better team communication, and less Friday-night fire drills. CI caught regressions early, and infra-as-code gave us repeatable environments.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">64. How Do You Ensure High Availability And Scalability With DevOps Practices?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is about systems that don’t break at 2 a.m.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Multiple AZs, health checks, and self-healing infra. Scalability, such as autoscaling groups, stateless services, and caching layers. IaC made it repeatable, and we tested failure modes regularly, not just in theory.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">65. What’s The Point Of Infrastructure As Code?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re asking if you treat your infra like real code or if it lives in a Word doc.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Clean answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“IaC means every change is tracked. We used Terraform for cloud infra, reviewed infra PRs like app code, and ran tests to catch bad configs. No more ‘it worked on my AWS account’ drama.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">66. How To Add Automated Tests To CI/CD?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is about balance. You can’t run 4-hour test suites on every push.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Smart breakdown</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Unit tests run at commit. Integration and API tests run in CI. Security scans before staging. Long e2e tests in nightly builds. Fast feedback matters, slow tests get ignored.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">67. Difference Between Blue-Green And Canary Deployments?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t confuse the two. They’re cousins, not twins.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Blue-green: deploy whole app to a new env, switch traffic all at once. Canary: send 1%, then 10%, then all traffic. Canary is better for catching slow leaks. Both need tight observability.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">68. What Is Container Orchestration? How Does Kubernetes Fit?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Again, no one cares if you can say “Kubernetes manages pods.”</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say This Instead</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We used K8s to run our containers; it handled rollout strategies, restarts, scaling, and DNS for services. Helm templated configurations, and Prometheus and Grafana provided us with observability. Took time to learn, but worth it once scale hit.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">69. How Do You Handle Rollback On A Failed Deployment?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If your answer involves SSH, you're in trouble.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Real Talk</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Blue-green makes rollback instant flip traffic back. With canary, stop rollout and revert. We had automated rollback if health checks failed within 5 minutes. Every deploy had a ‘get me out of jail’ plan.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">70. What’s Monitoring And Logging Look Like In DevOps?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is your pager sanity check.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Centralized logs (e.g., ELK), dashboards (Grafana), and alerts that actually mean something. We tagged everything by env and service. On-call needed one dashboard and one runbook per alert. Anything more? Chaos.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">71. How Do You Keep DevOps Secure?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re checking if you forgot about security in all your automations.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Secrets in vaults, not in code. SAST and DAST in CI. Terraform gets linted. Access keys rotate. Pipelines run with least privilege. We review pipeline permissions monthly because someone always forgets.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">72. What Is RPA, And Why Should Anyone Care?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This one’s not about hype. It’s about ROI.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“RPA bots click buttons so people don’t have to. We used it for invoice entry and account setup, saving 5 headcounts in 3 months. But it breaks if the UI changes, so we built monitors to catch silent failures.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">73. How Do You Implement A BPM Solution?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">BPM is just a grown-up flowchart… with drama.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say this</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We mapped the process first. Got stakeholders aligned. Piloted in one department using Camunda. Added metrics. Once it worked, scaled it org-wide. If you skip the pilot, you drown in feedback later.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">74. What Is Process Mining And Why Does It Matter?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’re either guessing or you’re using data. This helps with the second one.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Process mining uses logs to show how processes actually run, not how people think they run. We found our approval flow had 6 hidden hops. Fixed it, and cut cycle time by 30%.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">75. Process Automation Vs. Workflow Automation?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t waffle. Draw a clean line.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Process automation = bots doing tasks. Workflow automation = coordinating multiple tasks across people/systems. We used both: RPA for invoice entry, workflow tools for end-to-end order processing.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">76. How To Handle Exception Cases In Automated Business Processes?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Automation's cool until it runs into edge cases and falls apart.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Set clear rules for what counts as an exception. Route those to humans. Log everything. We used queues for retries and dashboards to track items that were stuck. Every month, we reviewed which exceptions were repeating and figured out if it was worth fixing upstream.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">77. What Are The Standard Tools In BPM and RPA?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want proof that you’ve used them, not a list generated by ChatGPT.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We used Appian for workflows because it integrated easily with SAP. For RPA, UiPath was solid drag-and-drop bots plus monitoring. Automation Anywhere for document scraping. Pick based on your stack and team skill don’t get tool-blind.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">78. How To Implement RPA with Existing IT Systems?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you just say “install bot,” you're skipping all the complex parts.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Honest Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Check if there's an API first bots on UIs break. For legacy apps, we used RPA with tight logging. We had devs write wrappers so bots didn’t touch raw screens. Every bot had a rollback plan and alerting. No silent fails allowed.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">79. What Metrics Tell You If Automation Is Working?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No vanity metrics. Real ones.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Time saved per process. Error rate before/after. Cost per transaction. Completion rate. We tracked these weekly and built a scorecard for execs. If it wasn’t saving time or money, we killed it.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">80. How To Make Sure Automated Processes Follow Business Rules?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re asking if bots follow the law or if they freelance.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Try This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Business rules lived in a config file, version-controlled. We ran checks in CI to catch invalid changes. Audits pulled from logs. Compliance signed off on rules before launch. Bots don’t get to improvise.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">81. What Does Ai Do For Process Automation?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Skip the “AI will change everything” nonsense.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We used AI to extract data from invoices and route cases. LLMs helped classify emails. But we still had humans in the loop, especially on edge cases. We retrained monthly with new data and flagged false positives in logs.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">82. Agile vs Waterfall?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want a battle-tested view, not textbook theory.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Agile is great when scope shifts and customers want feedback. Waterfall works when everything’s locked down, such as government contracts. We’ve used Agile for product development and Waterfall for compliance work. Pick the one that matches reality, not a trend.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">83. Scrum Framework: Roles And Ceremonies?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want to know you’ve actually sat through this stuff.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“PO owns backlog. Scrum Master removes blockers. Team builds. Ceremonies? Sprint planning sets goals, daily standup keeps everyone aligned, retros fix what’s broken, and reviews show progress. We kept meetings short and focused or they’d spiral.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">84. How To Manage Scope Changes In Agile?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is about not losing your mind mid-sprint.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“If a stakeholder wants a change mid-sprint, we push it to the backlog unless it’s a fire. Then we re-plan. Every request gets a tradeoff of time, effort, and priority. We document scope creep in retros so it doesn’t keep happening.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">85. Common project management challenges?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No fluff. They want scars.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Scope creep, unclear requirements, and poor communication. We fixed it with weekly syncs, shared docs, and ruthless backlog grooming. When stuff got off track, we owned it fast and reset.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">86. How To Measure Success In Consulting?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“client happiness” isn’t enough.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Try This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“On-time, on-budget, working solution. But also does it stick after we leave? We tracked adoption, followed up 30 days post-handoff, and got feedback on what actually helped. That’s the difference between deliverables and value.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">87. What Does Risk Management Do During Planning?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Not risk theater. Actual planning.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Identify what can go wrong, score it, assign owners, and write down mitigation steps. We updated risk logs weekly. When something tripped us up, we checked if it was in the register. If not, that was a miss on planning.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">88. What To Do If The Project Is Behind?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t blame the calendar. Fix the root.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Here’s The Move</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Triage the bottleneck. Re-scope if needed. Add resources if it makes sense. Reset expectations early. We’ve paused features to ensure the core is shipped on time. Then backfilled with follow-up sprints.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">89. Why Does Stakeholder Management Matter?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Because ignored stakeholders become blockers.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We mapped stakeholders at kickoff, did check-ins every sprint, and shared decisions early. Less surprises = less pushback. One time, skipping a check-in meant we built a feature no one used. Learned the hard way.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">90. How To Balance Time, Cost, And Quality?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want your actual decision process.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We used a tradeoff triangle: can’t have all three. If time was fixed, we cut scope. If quality mattered most, we padded the timeline. We involved stakeholders in those calls no silent compromises.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">91. How To Allocate Resources In Large Projects?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No theory. Real moves.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Start with the critical path staff that first. Map skill sets. For high-risk areas, put experienced devs. We used resource heatmaps weekly to catch overloads. If two teams fought for the same person, PMs had a prioritization meeting to settle it.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">92. How Do AI and ML Show Up In Real Business Apps?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Skip the buzzwords. Show the wiring.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Try this</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We used ML to predict churn in our SaaS app. Fed user behavior into a model, flagged at-risk users, and triggered outreach. On the ops side, anomaly detection on logs saved us from two major incidents.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">93. What Does Blockchain Solve In Enterprise Apps?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want one legit use case. Not hype.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Supply chain traceability. We used <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318131748_An_Overview_of_Blockchain_Technology_Architecture_Consensus_and_Future_Trends" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">blockchain to log every touchpoint</a> for luxury goods. Vendors couldn’t fake it. It worked because multiple orgs needed shared trust and no one wanted to host the DB.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">94. How Does IoT Help Supply Chains?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This one’s about visibility.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Live GPS on trucks. Condition monitoring on cold storage. Predictive maintenance for machines. We used edge devices to process alerts locally and only send up signals if something went wrong saved bandwidth and caught issues early.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">95. How to deploy an ML model to the cloud?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re checking if you can get past Jupyter notebooks.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Train model → validate → package → deploy as API (e.g., FastAPI + Docker) → autoscale on cloud (GCP, AWS). We monitored latency, input drift, and prediction skew. Retrained weekly with fresh data.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">96. Ethics in AI?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Say what you actually did, not what sounds nice.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We flagged bias during model dev, especially with imbalanced training data. Added explainability (SHAP) for decisions. Logged every prediction for traceability. And had a kill switch for human override if things looked off.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">97. What’s Deloitte Doing With Digital Twins?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Keep it tactical.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Digital twins let us simulate factories before changing configs. We tested what-if scenarios — such as increasing output by 10% without affecting actual machines. Big cost savings. Plus alerts when live data drifted from the model.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">98. What Does 5G Change For Businesses?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s not about speed. It’s about what's now possible.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We used 5G to stream real-time video from remote industrial sites with low latency. Enabled remote inspection, faster decisions, and more automation. Before that, cellular lag made it impossible.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">99. How To Evaluate New Tech For The Business?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t just say “run a pilot.” Explain how.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“We mapped value vs. risk. Ran a 2-week spike with clear success criteria. Checked team skills, integration pain, and vendor lock-in. If it passed the sniff test, we budgeted for a real trial. No shiny object syndrome.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">100. What Can Quantum Computing Do For Enterprise?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They don’t want sci-fi. Give one near-term use.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Try This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Optimization problems like logistics routing or portfolio balancing. Still in research, but we explored hybrid models that hand off edge cases to quantum solvers. Early stage, but promising in narrow domains.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">101. How To Integrate New Tech With Legacy Systems?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is about not breaking everything that’s already working.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Say</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Start by finding the integration points APIs, flat files, middleware. Wrap legacy with adapters. Run new and old in parallel for a bit. Monitor outputs to catch drift. Always have a rollback plan and test it.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Related Reading</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Roblox Coding Assessment Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Tiktok Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Ebay Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">SpaceX Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Airbnb Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Stripe Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Figma Software Engineer Interview</li><li class="text-gray-300">LinkedIn Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Coinbase Software Engineer Interview</li><li class="text-gray-300">Salesforce Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Snowflake Coding Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Tesla Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Datadog Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">JPMorgan Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Affirm Software Engineer Interview</li><li class="text-gray-300">Lockheed Martin Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Walmart Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Anduril Software Engineer Interview</li><li class="text-gray-300">Atlassian Coding Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Cisco Software Engineer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Goldman Sachs Software Engineer Interview Questions</li></ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">How to Prepare for a Software Engineer Role at Deloitte</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Grinding random LeetCode sets won’t get you through Deloitte interviews.
