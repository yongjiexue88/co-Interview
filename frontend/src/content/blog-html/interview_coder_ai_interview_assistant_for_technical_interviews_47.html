Every device on a network has an IP address, and DNS maps readable names to those addresses so users can type example.com instead of a numeric IP.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. What is a Firewall?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A firewall is a hardware or software device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic and allows, blocks, or drops packets based on configured security rules. Firewalls enforce access policies, isolate segments, and reduce exposure to unauthorized connections.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. What is a VPN?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel over an insecure network like the Internet so a remote user or site can securely access a private network. It uses tunneling protocols and encryption to protect data in transit and to extend private network access across public infrastructure.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. What are the Different Sources of Malware?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/malware/types-of-malware?" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">different sources of malware</a> are given below:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Worms:</strong> Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks or email without needing a host file.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Spyware:</strong> Runs in the background to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data to attackers. Ransomware: Encrypts files and demands payment to return or delete the data. </li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Virus:</strong> Attaches to files or programs and executes when the host runs, spreading to other files.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Trojan:</strong> Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software; they do not self-replicate but enable backdoors or data theft.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Adware:</strong> Tracks user behavior to display targeted ads and can be intrusive or privacy-invasive.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. How Does Email Work?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When a sender sends an email, the client hands it to an SMTP server. <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/smtp/?" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">SMTP routes messages</a>, potentially through multiple mail servers, and consults DNS to find the recipient’s mail server. The recipient’s server stores the message until the recipient retrieves it using POP or IMAP. If servers cannot connect, messages may queue and be delivered later or returned as undeliverable if delivery fails for too long.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. What is the Difference Between Active and Passive Cyber Attacks?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Active Cyber Attack:</strong> The attacker modifies or attempts to modify message content or system resources. Active attacks threaten integrity and availability, often producing detectable changes.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Passive Cyber Attack:</strong> The attacker observes or copies message content without altering it. Passive attacks threaten confidentiality and are often stealthy because they do not change the system state.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. What is a Social Engineering Attack?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Social engineering <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/avoiding-social-engineering-and-phishing-attacks?" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">manipulates people into revealing information</a>, granting access, or taking actions that help an attacker. Techniques include phone pretexts, phishing, and using public data like birthdays to guess credentials.

Define Encryption and Decryption?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Encryption transforms plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and key so unauthorized parties cannot read it. Decryption reverses that process using the correct key to restore the original plaintext. Encryption protects confidentiality during storage and transit.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. What is the Difference Between Plaintext and Cleartext?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Plaintext is data that has not been encrypted. Cleartext refers to information transmitted or stored without encryption and not intended to be encrypted. In both cases, the content is readable without decryption.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. What is a Block Cipher?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A block cipher encrypts fixed-size blocks of plaintext (commonly 64 or 128 bits) into ciphertext using a symmetric key. Modes like ECB and CBC describe how blocks chain together to <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/block-cipher?" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">handle longer messages</a> and to add randomness and integrity properties.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">14. What is the CIA Triangle?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The CIA Triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These three goals guide information security policies: keep data private, keep it accurate and unaltered, and keep services available when needed.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15. What is the Three-Way Handshake?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a full-duplex reliable connection. The client sends SYN, the server replies SYN plus ACK, and the client sends ACK. This exchange synchronizes sequence numbers and confirms both sides are ready to communicate.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">16. How Can Identity Theft Be Prevented?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Steps to prevent identity theft:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Use strong, unique passwords and never share PINs.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Enable two-factor authentication for email and key services.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Protect devices with passwords and avoid installing untrusted software.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Limit what you post on social media and verify payment gateways before entering credentials.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Rotate passwords and avoid giving personal data over the phone unless you initiated the call.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">17. What Are Some Common Hashing Functions?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/hash-functions-and-list-types-of-hash-functions/?" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">hash function</a> maps input data of any size to a fixed-size value used for indexing, integrity checks, or fingerprinting. Types and simple methods include:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Division Method</li><li class="text-gray-300">Mid Square Method</li><li class="text-gray-300">Folding Method</li><li class="text-gray-300">Multiplication Method</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">In cryptographic practice, algorithms like the SHA family and bcrypt are standard for integrity and password storage.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. What Do You Mean by Two-Factor Authentication?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Two-factor authentication requires two independent methods to verify identity, typically something you know (password) plus something you have (token or phone) or something you are (biometrics). It raises the effort required for attackers to gain access.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">19. What Does XSS Stand For? How Can It Be Prevented?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS?" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Cross-site scripting (XSS)</a> is a vulnerability where attackers inject scripts that a web application serves to other users’ browsers.

What Do You Mean By Shoulder Surfing?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A shoulder surfing attack happens when someone nearby visually observes a screen or keyboard to capture passwords, PINs, or other sensitive information. This low-tech method can lead to privacy invasion and unauthorized access if people do not shield inputs.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">21. What is the Difference Between Hashing and Encryption?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Hashing:</strong> Converts data to a short fixed value used for indexing, integrity checks, and comparisons. Hashing is one-way; you cannot recover the original data from the hash. Hash outputs are fixed length, and collisions can occur.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Encryption:</strong> Encodes data so authorized users with the key can reverse the process and recover the original plaintext. Encrypted output size varies with input length and the right key and algorithm allow decryption.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">22. Differentiate Between Information Security and Information Assurance</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Information Assurance:</strong> Focuses on managing risks to information through controls that preserve integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality across systems and processes.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Information Security:</strong> Focuses on protecting information by reducing risks of unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure, and on preventing incidents through technology and policy.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">23. Write a Difference Between HTTPS and SSL</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">HTTPS:</strong> Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure combines HTTP with a cryptographic layer so browsers and servers exchange content over an encrypted channel.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">SSL:</strong> Secure Sockets Layer is a cryptographic protocol used historically to secure transport; TLS replaces it. SSL/TLS provides encryption and authentication that HTTPS uses to protect web traffic.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">24. What Do You Mean by System Hardening?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/systems-hardening?" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">System hardening</a> is the process of reducing a system’s attack surface by:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Removing or configuring unnecessary services</li><li class="text-gray-300">Closing open ports</li><li class="text-gray-300">Changing default passwords</li><li class="text-gray-300">Applying patches and secure settings</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The goal is to reduce vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">25.

For legacy systems, Blowfish may still be encountered; new designs should choose AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption and better performance on modern CPUs and constrained devices.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. What is the Difference Between a Vulnerability and an Exploit?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A vulnerability is a flaw in design, configuration, or code that allows unintended behavior. Examples include insecure deserialization, missing authentication checks, or open ports. An exploit is a technique or tool that leverages the vulnerability to achieve the attacker's objectives, such as:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Code execution</li><li class="text-gray-300">Data exfiltration</li><li class="text-gray-300">Privilege escalation</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Proactive Vulnerability Defense</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Effective risk management separates discovery and remediation of vulnerabilities from the lifecycle of exploit development by patching, compensating controls, intrusion detection, and rapid CVE triage driven by threat intelligence.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. What do you understand by Risk, Vulnerability, and Threat in a Network?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A threat is an actor or condition that could cause harm, from organized APT groups to opportunistic malware. A vulnerability is a weakness that an actor can exploit. Risk is the estimated impact and likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, producing loss. For qualitative assessments, use structured frameworks like:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">FAIR for quantitative risk</li><li class="text-gray-300">NIST SP 800-30</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Map assets, threat sources, controls, and residual risk; then prioritize remediation where likelihood times impact exceeds risk appetite. Embed this into governance, compliance mapping, and continuous monitoring to track changes in exposure.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. What Do You Mean by Forward Secrecy, and How Does It Work?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Forward secrecy ensures past session keys remain confidential even if long-term private keys are later compromised. Protocols achieve this by negotiating ephemeral session keys using Diffie-Hellman variants such as DHE or ECDHE, where each session uses fresh ephemeral keys that are not derivable from a server’s static private key.<br><br>For implementation, enforce ECDHE cipher suites, avoid static RSA key exchange, and manage ephemeral key parameters and lifetimes. Forward secrecy reduces blast radius for leaked private keys and aligns with compliance expectations for cryptographic agility.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Discuss the Challenges and Strategies of Securing IoT Devices</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">IoT security faces several challenges, including device heterogeneity, constrained CPU and memory, insecure supply chains, weak or hard-coded credentials, and long device lifecycles with poor patching.

Differentiate between Stream Cipher and Block Cipher</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Block ciphers encrypt fixed-size blocks (e.g., AES 128-bit) and operate in modes such as CBC, GCM, or ECB with distinct security properties. Stream ciphers generate a keystream combined with plaintext byte by byte or bit by bit; examples include ChaCha20. Stream ciphers are efficient for low-latency or streaming data and for constrained devices.<br><br>Modern guidance favors authenticated encryption like AES GCM or ChaCha20 Poly1305 to provide confidentiality and integrity. Choose based on throughput, nonce management, and whether the data requires random access.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. What Do You Mean by Perimeter-Based and Data-Based Protection?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Perimeter protection focuses on preventing unauthorized access at network boundaries using firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs, and edge controls. Data-based protection secures the data regardless of location through:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Encryption</li><li class="text-gray-300">Tokenization</li><li class="text-gray-300">DLP</li><li class="text-gray-300">Classification</li><li class="text-gray-300">Rights management</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Data-Centric Security</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">As cloud adoption expands, defenses must shift from perimeter-centric models to data-centric controls, applying encryption in transit and at rest, robust key management, and persistent access controls so data remains protected across:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Devices</li><li class="text-gray-300">Cloud services</li><li class="text-gray-300">Third-parties</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">19. Which is More Reliable: SSL or HTTPS?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">HTTPS is HTTP transported over TLS (formerly SSL). SSL refers to obsolete protocol versions with known weaknesses; modern deployments must use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 with secure ciphers and proper certificate management. Therefore, HTTPS implemented with current TLS versions is the reliable, safe option for web traffic. Ensure TLS configurations:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Follow industry best practices</li><li class="text-gray-300">Disable legacy ciphers</li><li class="text-gray-300">Enable forward secrecy</li><li class="text-gray-300">Monitor certificate lifecycles and OCSP/CRL status for governance and compliance.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">20. Differentiate between Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Symmetric encryption uses a single shared secret for both encryption and decryption, performing well on bulk data (AES, ChaCha20). Asymmetric encryption uses key pairs: public keys for encryption or signature verification and private keys for decryption or signing (RSA, ECC).</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Hybrid Encryption</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Practical systems combine both: asymmetric algorithms establish keys or authenticate endpoints while symmetric keys provide efficient data encryption. Key management, rotation, and hardware protection differ: symmetric keys require secure distribution; asymmetric keys require secure private key custody and certificate lifecycle management.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">21. What Do You Mean by a DDoS Attack? How Can You Prevent It?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A distributed denial of service attack floods targets with traffic or resource requests from many sources to degrade or deny service. Preventive measures include traffic scrubbing and volumetric defenses via:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Cloud DDoS protection services</li><li class="text-gray-300">Rate limiting</li><li class="text-gray-300">Anycast load distribution</li><li class="text-gray-300">Autoscaling</li><li class="text-gray-300">Application layer protections (WAF)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Redundant architecture with failover</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">DDoS Readiness &amp; Response</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Operational readiness demands a DDoS response plan, runbooks to reroute traffic, blackholing only as a last resort, and collaboration with ISPs and CDNs. Combine telemetry thresholds in your SOC to trigger automated mitigations and post-event forensic capture to harden defenses.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">22. Differentiate between IDS and IPS in the context of Cyber Security</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An intrusion detection system monitors and alerts on suspicious traffic or host behavior without directly interrupting flows. An intrusion prevention system sits inline and can block or drop traffic deemed malicious. IDS fits monitoring pipelines and forensic analysis; IPS performs active blocking at perimeter or micro segmentation enforcement points.<br><br>Choose placement based on risk tolerance: IPS can prevent known threats but may introduce false positives; IDS supports investigation and correlation in SIEM. Combine both with tuned signatures, anomaly detection, and rapid rollback capabilities.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">23. What Do You Mean by Network Sniffing?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><a href="https://www.twingate.com/blog/glossary/network%20sniffing?" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Network sniffing</a> captures packets traversing a network segment to inspect headers and payloads. Administrators use sniffers for troubleshooting, protocol analysis, and forensic collection. Attackers use sniffing to harvest credentials, session tokens, or unencrypted data. Defenses include:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Network encryption (TLS, IPsec)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Port security</li><li class="text-gray-300">Disabling promiscuous modes</li><li class="text-gray-300">EDR to detect packet capture processes</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Legal and compliance policies govern packet capture, and logged captures should preserve the chain of custody for investigations.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">24. Differentiate between Black Box Testing and White Box Testing</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Black box testing assesses a system from the outside with no knowledge of internals; it mirrors attacker reconnaissance and focuses on attack surface and behavior. White box testing gives full internal access to code, architecture, and configurations, enabling deeper vulnerability identification, such as:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Logic flaws</li><li class="text-gray-300">Insecure libraries</li><li class="text-gray-300">Improper error handling</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use black box for validation of production defenses and white box for secure development and code-level remediation. Hybrid approaches accelerate coverage and reduce false positives in remediation cycles.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">25. What Do You Mean by System Hardening?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">System hardening is the disciplined process of removing unnecessary services, enforcing secure configurations, applying least privilege, disabling default accounts, patching, and implementing host-based controls such as:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">HIDS</li><li class="text-gray-300">Application allow lists</li><li class="text-gray-300">Secure baselines</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">System Hardening &amp; Automation</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Hardening covers OS, middleware, applications, databases, and network stacks. Use automated configuration management, compliance as code, and regular audits against benchmarks such as:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">CIS</li><li class="text-gray-300">DISA STIGs</li><li class="text-gray-300">Vendor best practices</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Track deviations as remediation tickets and measure hardening maturity through reduced vulnerability exposure.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">26. Differentiate Between VPN and VLAN</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A virtual private network (VPN) creates an encrypted tunnel between endpoints across untrusted networks, providing confidentiality and integrity for traffic. A virtual local area network (VLAN) logically segments a switched network to separate broadcast domains within the same physical infrastructure.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">VLANs vs. VPNs</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">VLANs support network isolation and traffic separation, but do not provide encryption by themselves. Use VLANs for internal segmentation and traffic control, and VPNs for secure remote access or inter-site connectivity. In cloud environments, combine segmentation with:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Secure tunnels</li><li class="text-gray-300">Identity controls</li><li class="text-gray-300">CSPM to maintain policy consistency</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">27. Differentiate Between Spear Phishing and Phishing?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Phishing casts wide nets with generic social engineering content to trap many victims, while spear phishing targets specific individuals or groups with tailored messages often supported by reconnaissance and impersonation. Spear phishing yields higher success rates against high-value targets and is commonly used in APT campaigns.<br><br>Defenses include email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), targeted awareness training, simulated phishing exercises, advanced email filtering with URL and attachment sandboxing, and safe link services.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">28. What Do You Mean by SQL Injection? How Do You Prevent It?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">SQL injection occurs when untrusted input is incorporated into database queries without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Execute arbitrary SQL</li><li class="text-gray-300">Exfiltrate data</li><li class="text-gray-300">Modify records</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Prevent by using parameterized queries or prepared statements, least privilege database accounts, stored procedures without string concatenation, input validation combined with allow lists, ORM safe modes, and Web Application Firewalls tuned to block injection patterns.<br><br>Maintain secure coding standards, include SAST/DAST in CI pipelines, and keep OWASP Top 10 mitigations part of your appsec program.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">29. What is the Difference Between a Virus and a Worm?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A virus attaches itself to host files or executables and requires user action to propagate, often modifying or deleting files. A worm is self-propagating and spreads across networks or systems without direct user interaction, typically to consume resources or deliver payloads. Both can provide secondary payloads like ransomware.<br><br>Countermeasures include endpoint protection with behavioral detection, network segmentation, timely patching, and egress filtering to slow propagation during an outbreak.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">30. How Do You Decide the Placement of the Encryption Function?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Decide placement by threat model and trust boundaries. Link encryption (e.g., TLS between hops) protects data on each link but exposes plaintext at intermediaries like proxies or load balancers. End-to-end encryption ensures only endpoints can decrypt, protecting data through intermediaries and multi-hop paths; it requires key management and endpoint trust.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Application-Level Encryption</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">For cloud and multi-tenant systems, prefer defense in depth: use transport encryption, application-level encryption for:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Sensitive fields</li><li class="text-gray-300">Tokenization</li><li class="text-gray-300">Dedicated key management (KMS, HSM)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Consider performance, searchability, and compliance constraints when choosing placement.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">31. What Do You Mean by Active Reconnaissance?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Active reconnaissance involves interacting directly with targets using probing tools such as:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Port scanners</li><li class="text-gray-300">Ping sweeps</li><li class="text-gray-300">Traceroute</li><li class="text-gray-300">Banner grabbing to enumerate services</li><li class="text-gray-300">Versions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Potential weaknesses</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Active Reconnaissance</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It yields accurate, up-to-date data but generates detectable noise and increases exposure to defensive controls. Conduct active recon in authorized tests under clear rules of engagement, correlate findings with passive intelligence feeds, and use results to simulate realistic exploitation paths during red team or purple team exercises.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">32. What Do You Mean by Forward Secrecy and How Does It Work?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Forward secrecy prevents compromise of past session keys if a long-term private key is later leaked by deriving ephemeral session keys per session using Diffie-Hellman variants like DHE or ECDHE. Each session’s keys are independent; an adversary who obtains a server's private key cannot retroactively decrypt recorded traffic.<br><br>Enforce ECDHE cipher suites in TLS, rotate ephemeral parameters appropriately, and combine with certificate management and HSM protection for long-term keys to reduce exposure.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Related Reading</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Coding Interview Tools</li><li class="text-gray-300">Jira Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Coding Interview Platforms</li><li class="text-gray-300">Common Algorithms For Interviews</li><li class="text-gray-300">Questions To Ask Interviewer Software Engineer</li><li class="text-gray-300">Java Selenium Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Python Basic Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">RPA Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Angular 6 Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Best Job Boards For Software Engineers</li><li class="text-gray-300">Leetcode Cheat Sheet</li><li class="text-gray-300">Software Engineer Interview Prep</li><li class="text-gray-300">Technical Interview Cheat Sheet</li><li class="text-gray-300">Common C# Interview Questions</li></ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Nail Coding Interviews with our AI Interview Assistant: Get Your Dream Job Today</h2><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Spending months grinding LeetCode, hoping to pass one tech interview?
