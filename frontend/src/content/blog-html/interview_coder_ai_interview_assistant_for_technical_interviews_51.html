What is Java? A Concise Definition of the Platform</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for portability, write once, run anywhere. Compiled Java bytecode runs on any platform with a compatible JVM, making Java a general-purpose choice for server, desktop, and mobile applications.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. JDK, JRE, and JVM: How They Fit Together</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">JVM (Java Virtual Machine) runs Java bytecode and converts it to machine instructions at runtime. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) packages the JVM plus the core libraries and runtime files needed to run Java programs. JDK (Java Development Kit) includes the JRE plus developer tools (compiler, debugger, etc.) used to build Java applications.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. Variables in Java: What They Are and Why Types Matter</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Variables are named containers for data. Java is statically typed, so you declare a variable with a type (int, String, double, etc.) before using it. Types determine storage, valid operations, and compile-time checks.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. Typecasting in Java: Converting Between Types</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Typecasting converts a value from one type to another. Widening casting (implicit) converts smaller to larger types, e.g., int to long. Narrowing casting (explicit) converts larger to smaller types and requires a cast, e.g., (int) 3.14.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. Declaring Arrays: Fixed-Size Collections</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An array holds a fixed number of values of one type.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Example declarations:</strong>int[] myIntArray = new int[10];String[] myStringArray = new String[50];</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. The Main Method: Java's Entry Point</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The main method is the program entry point and must be public, static, return void, and accept a String array:public static void main(String[] args) { // program starts here}</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. Literals: Fixed Values in Code</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Literals are fixed values written directly in code, such as 100, -90, 3.14F, 'A', and "Hello". They represent constants of primitive or String types.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. Constructors: How Objects Get Initialized</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A constructor is a special method called when creating an object. It has no return type and shares the class name. Constructors initialize instance state.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. Method Overloading: Same Name, Different Parameters</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists. It resolves at compile time and supports clearer APIs.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Packages: Organizing Classes and Interfaces</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A package is a namespace grouping related classes and interfaces. Use packages to avoid name collisions and to structure code like folders.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. What is OOP: The Object-Centered Approach</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Object-oriented programming models software as objects with fields and methods. It emphasizes modeling real-world entities, encapsulating state, and defining behaviour on that state.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. OOP Principles: Four Pillars That Guide Design</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Encapsulation: </strong>Bundle state and behavior; hide internal details.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Abstraction: </strong>Expose a simple interface while hiding complexity.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Inheritance: </strong>Derive new classes from existing ones to reuse code.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Polymorphism: </strong>Let objects present different behaviors under a common type.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. Inheritance: Reusing and Extending Behavior</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Inheritance lets a class inherit fields and methods from a parent class, enabling code reuse and subtype relationships.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">14. Interfaces: Contracts for Behavior</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An interface defines method signatures (and since Java 8 default and static methods). Classes implement interfaces to promise certain behavior without specifying implementation.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15. Abstract Classes vs Interfaces: When to Choose Which</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Abstract class: can have both abstract and concrete methods and state; used when classes share common implementation. Interface: defines a contract; used for multiple inheritance of type and to decouple behavior.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">16. Polymorphism: One Reference, Many Behaviors</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Polymorphism lets a parent type reference point to child objects; method calls dispatch to the actual runtime implementation. It supports flexible and extensible code.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">17. Method Overriding: Customize Inherited Behavior</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Overriding provides a subclass-specific implementation of a superclass method with the same signature. Use @Override to signal intent and enable runtime polymorphism.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. The Super Keyword: Access Parent Class Members</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use super to call a superclass constructor or to refer to superclass methods/fields when overridden or hidden.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">19. Getters and Setters: Controlled Access to Fields</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Getters and setters are methods that read and modify private fields. They enforce encapsulation:public int getNum() { return num; }public void setNum(int num) { this.num = num; }</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">20. Static: Class-Level Members</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Static marks members that belong to the class rather than instances. Static fields and methods are shared across all instances.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">21. Exception Handling: Managing Runtime Errors</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Exception handling uses try, catch, and finally to manage runtime errors and keep program flow predictable when exceptions occur.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">22. Try-Catch Blocks: Catch Exceptions Where They Occur</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Place risky code in try and handle exceptions in catch blocks. You may chain multiple catch blocks or use finally for cleanup.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">23. Finally Block: Cleanup that Always Runs</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Finally contains code that executes after try/catch whether an exception occurred or not, commonly used to release resources.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">24. What is an Exception: An Error Signal at Runtime</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An exception is a runtime problem signaled by an object that can interrupt normal flow; catch or declare it to handle the condition.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">25. Checked Exceptions: Enforced at Compile Time</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Checked exceptions must be declared or handled by the calling code (e.g., IOException, SQLException). The compiler enforces handling or declaration.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">26. Unchecked Exceptions: Runtime Problems Not Required to Be Declared</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Unchecked exceptions extend RuntimeException and are not checked by the compiler. They usually indicate programming errors like NullPointerException.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">27. Throws Keyword: Declaring Exceptions</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use throws in a method signature to declare that it may propagate certain checked exceptions to its caller.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">28. Throw vs Throws: Throwing and Declaring Exceptions</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Throw explicitly raises an exception instance. Throws in a method signature declares which checked exceptions may be propagated.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">29. Using Throw: Explicitly Raise an Error</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use throw inside a method to signal a specific error condition by providing an exception instance, e.g., throw new IllegalArgumentException("bad arg");</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">30. Custom Exceptions: Tailor Error Types</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Create a custom exception by extending Exception or RuntimeException to express application-specific error conditions and improve clarity.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">31. String API: Working with Text</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The String API provides methods to manipulate text: length(), substring(), equals(), indexOf(), replace(), split(), and more. Strings are central for input, output, and data handling.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">32. String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer: Mutability and Threading</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">String is immutable. StringBuilder is mutable and not synchronized, offering fast single-threaded concatenation. StringBuffer is mutable and synchronized, safe for concurrent access.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">33. Immutable Objects: Predictable, Thread-Friendly State</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Immutable objects cannot change after creation. They simplify reasoning and avoid many concurrency bugs; String is a common example.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">34. Wrapper Classes: Object Forms of Primitives</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Wrapper classes (Integer, Character, Double, etc.) wrap primitive values into objects so you can use them with collections and APIs expecting objects.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">35. Autoboxing and Unboxing: Automatic Conversion</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Autoboxing converts primitives to their wrapper types automatically. Unboxing converts wrapper objects back to primitives. Example: Integer i = 5; int j = i;</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">36. Collections API: Data Structures and Algorithms</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The Collections API (java.util) provides interfaces and implementations for lists, sets, queues, and maps, plus utility methods for sorting, searching, and synchronization.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">37. Generics: Type-Safe Reusable Code</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Generics let you parameterize classes and methods with types. They enforce compile-time type safety and reduce casts, e.g., List&lt;String&gt; avoids inserting wrong types.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">38. Iterator Interface: Uniform Traversal</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Iterator lets you traverse a Collection with hasNext() and next(), and remove elements safely during iteration.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">39. Iterator vs ListIterator: Forward vs Bidirectional</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Iterator supports forward traversal and element removal. ListIterator supports bidirectional traversal, element modification, and index queries for lists.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">40. Map: Key-Value Data Structures</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Map associates unique keys to values. Common implementations include HashMap (fast lookup), TreeMap (sorted keys), and LinkedHashMap (insertion order).</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">41. Concurrency: Running Tasks in Parallel</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Concurrency enables multiple tasks or parts of a program to run at once, improving throughput on multicore systems when designed correctly.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">42. Thread: A Path of Execution</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A thread represents an independent path of execution within a program. Multiple threads share process memory and can run concurrently.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">43. Process vs Thread: Isolation and Sharing</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A process is an independent program instance with its own memory and resources. Threads are lightweight execution paths within a process that share memory and resources.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">44. Multithreading: Multiple Threads in One Program</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Multithreading runs several threads within the same application to perform tasks concurrently, improving responsiveness and resource utilization.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">45. Synchronized Keyword: Mutual Exclusion Tool</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use synchronized on methods or blocks to ensure only one thread at a time executes the protected code for a given monitor, preventing race conditions on shared state.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">46. Deadlock: Threads Waiting Forever</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Deadlock happens when threads wait on each other for locks, creating a cycle with no progress. Avoid by consistent lock ordering or using tryLock with timeouts.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">47. Thread States: Life Cycle of a Thread</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Threads move through states: New, Runnable, Blocked (waiting for a monitor), Waiting (awaiting another thread), Timed Waiting (waiting with timeout), and Terminated after completion.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">48. Volatile Keyword: Visibility Without Locking</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Volatile marks a variable whose reads and writes go straight to main memory. It ensures visibility across threads for single reads/writes but does not provide atomicity for compound operations.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">49. Thread Safety: Safe Concurrent Use</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Thread safety means code behaves correctly when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Achieve it via immutability, synchronization, or concurrency utilities from java.util.concurrent.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">50. Creating Threads: Two Common Ways</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Extend Thread and override run():public class MyThread extends Thread { public void run() { System.out.println("Thread running"); }}Or implement Runnable and pass to a Thread:public class MyRunnable implements Runnable { public void run() { System.out.println("Runnable running"); }}</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">51. Stream API: Declarative Collection Processing</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Streams provide a pipeline for processing collections with operations like map, filter, sort, and reduce, enabling concise and expressive transformations.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">52. Benefits of Streams: Cleaner Bulk Operations</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Streams make code shorter and clearer for bulk operations, support parallel execution easily, and separate what to do from how to iterate.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">53. Obtaining a Stream from a List: Start the Pipeline</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Create a stream from a list:List&lt;String&gt; myList = Arrays.asList("a1", "a2", "b1", "c2", "c1");Stream&lt;String&gt; myStream = myList.stream();</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">54. Map vs FlatMap: One-to-One vs Flattening</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Map applies a function to each element, producing a stream of results one-to-one. FlatMap maps elements to streams and flattens them into a single stream.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">55. Filter in Streams: Keep Elements That Match</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Filter takes a Predicate and retains only elements that satisfy it, producing a smaller stream for downstream operations.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">56. Sorting a Stream: Use Sorted()</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Sort a stream and collect results:List&lt;String&gt; sortedList = myList.stream() .sorted() .collect(Collectors.toList());</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">57. Terminal Operations: Produce Results or Side Effects</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Terminal operations end a stream pipeline and produce a result or side effect. Examples: forEach, collect, reduce, count.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">58. Collect Method: Gather Stream Results</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Collect is a terminal operation that accumulates stream elements into a collection or other result using Collectors, e.g., Collectors.toList() or Collectors.toMap().</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">59. ForEach: Iterate a Stream</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ForEach applies a Consumer to each element of the stream as a terminal operation. It consumes the stream and cannot be reused afterward.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">60. Reduce: Combine Elements Into One</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Reduce folds stream elements into a single value using an identity and a BinaryOperator, useful for sums, concatenation, or custom aggregation.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">61. JDBC: Java Access to Relational Databases</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">JDBC is the Java API for executing SQL and interacting with relational databases from Java applications.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">62.

Handling SQL Exceptions: Catch SQLException</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Wrap JDBC calls in try/catch to handle SQLException and free resources in finally, or use try-with-resources:try { // JDBC code} catch (SQLException ex) { // handle error}</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">70. Connection Pooling: Reuse Database Connections</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Connection pooling reuses open connections to reduce the overhead of opening and closing connections, improving performance in database-heavy applications.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">71. List Interface: Ordered Collections with Index Access</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">List represents an ordered sequence allowing positional access, insertion, and removal. Common implementations include ArrayList and LinkedList.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">72. Iterating Over a List — Simple Loop Example</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use an enhanced for loop:List&lt;String&gt; list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");for(String fruit : list) { System.out.println(fruit);}</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">73. ArrayList vs LinkedList: When to Pick Which</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ArrayList uses a dynamic array offering fast random access and good cache locality. LinkedList stores nodes with pointers, providing cheaper insertions/removals in the middle.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">74. Removing Elements From a List: By Index or Object</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use remove(Object) to remove the first matching element or remove(index) to remove by position:list.remove("apple");list.remove(0);</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">75. Vector and Stack Classes: Legacy Synchronized Types</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Vector is like ArrayList, but synchronized.

Apart from the Security Aspect, What Are the Reasons Behind Making Strings Immutable in Java?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interviewers probe design decisions to see if you understand tradeoffs in language design, memory optimization, and concurrency implications. This question tests knowledge of the String intern pool, thread-safety, and how immutability affects collections and caching.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">How to answer:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Mention String pool and sharing of literals requiring immutability to avoid accidental mutation.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Explain thread-safety: immutable objects remove need for synchronization when shared across threads.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Describe effects on collections (hash-based keys) and predictable behavior in hashing.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Example answer:</strong>Java strings are immutable to enable safe sharing and efficient reuse via the String pool, avoiding copies of identical literal values. Immutability provides inherent thread-safety so strings can be shared across threads without synchronization. Finally, immutable strings make them reliable keys in hash-based collections, preventing changes that would break lookups.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. Singleton in Java: One Instance, Many Uses</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Question:</strong></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What is a singleton class in Java? How do you implement a singleton class?</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Why you might get asked this:</strong></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The question checks understanding of object lifecycle, global access patterns, and thread-safety.

Use lazy initialization with double-checked locking or prefer enum for a simple, safe singleton. Example (thread-safe, lazy):Approach: lazy init with volatile and double-checked locking.Code:public class MySingleton { private static volatile MySingleton instance; private MySingleton() {} public static MySingleton getInstance() { if (instance == null) { synchronized (MySingleton.class) { if (instance == null) instance = new MySingleton(); } } return instance; }}Commentary: volatile prevents instruction reordering; synchronized block avoids locking every call. For most use cases, an enum-based singleton (enum S { INSTANCE; }) is simpler and handles serialization and reflection better.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3.

Lines 1 and 4 are valid.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4.

StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable and live on the heap; StringBuilder is faster for single-threaded string construction, while StringBuffer is synchronized for thread-safety. Typical use: StringBuilder for building strings in loops; StringBuffer when multiple threads append to same buffer.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5.

Abstract classes can hold instance state, constructors, protected/private members, and concrete methods. Use interfaces for multiple behavioral contracts and abstract classes when you need shared code and state.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6.

The class declares both abstract and final, which are incompatible—abstract requires subclassing while final prevents it. Expect at least one compilation error: illegal combination of modifiers. The chain of inheritance would also be affected because a final class cannot be extended.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. Comparator Basics: Custom Sort Logic</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Question:</strong></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What is a Comparator in Java?</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Why you might get asked this:</strong></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Sorting custom objects is a common task; interviewers check if you know how to provide custom ordering separate from natural ordering (Comparable).</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">How to answer:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Define Comparator as a functional interface for custom comparison via compare(T o1, T o2).</li><li class="text-gray-300">Use Collections.sort or sort on streams to define ordering independent of an object's natural order.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Mention null handling and comparator composition utilities (Comparator.comparing, thenComparing).</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Example answer:</strong>Comparator is a strategy interface to compare two objects externally. Implement compare(T a, T b) to define ordering, and supply it to Collections.sort(list, comparator) or list.sort(comparator). Java 8+ adds Comparator.comparing and thenComparing for concise, composable comparators.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. Method Hiding vs Overriding: Static and Private Methods</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Question:</strong> In Java, static as well as private method overriding is possible. Comment on the statement.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Why you might get asked this:</strong> The interviewer wants to confirm you know the difference between overriding and hiding, and how visibility and static context affect polymorphism.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">How to answer:</strong>- State that static methods are class-level and cannot be overridden; a child can declare the same static signature, but it hides the parent method.- Explain that private methods are not visible to subclasses, so they cannot be overridden; a method with the same name in a subclass is a different method.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Example answer:</strong>The statement is false. Static methods are resolved at compile time and can be hidden by a subclass method with the same signature, not overridden. Private methods are not inherited, so a subclass cannot override them; declaring a same-signature private method in subclass defines a separate method.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. HashSet vs TreeSet: Speed vs Order</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Question:</strong></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What makes a HashSet different from a TreeSet?</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Why you might get asked this:</strong></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This checks understanding of core collections, complexity guarantees, ordering guarantees, and object comparison requirements—key for data structure selection.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">How to answer:</strong>- Explain backing structures: HashSet uses a hash table (unordered), TreeSet uses a red-black tree (sorted).- Mention complexity: HashSet average O(1) for add/contains/remove; TreeSet O(log n).- Note comparison methods and null handling: HashSet uses hashCode/equals; TreeSet uses Comparable or Comparator and does not allow null for elements that require comparison.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Example answer:</strong>HashSet stores elements in a hash table for fast average O(1) access and allows one null key; ordering is not guaranteed. TreeSet uses a balanced tree to keep elements sorted and provides O(log n) operations; it requires elements to be Comparable or provide a Comparator and generally disallows null.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10.

Although Inheritance is a Popular OOPs Concept, It is Less Advantageous than Composition. Explain.</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interviewers test whether you understand object relationships, coupling, testability, and maintainability. This question probes design judgment and practical trade-offs in object-oriented design. </p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">How to answer:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Explain composition as "has-a" and inheritance as "is-a", focusing on coupling and flexibility.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Give concrete reasons: multiple behavior reuse, encapsulation, easier unit testing, and reduced fragility to superclass changes.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Provide a short code example showing how composition avoids a brittle inheritance change and explain the difference.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Example answer:<br><br></strong>Composition builds objects by containing other objects; inheritance ties a subclass directly to a superclass. Composition keeps coupling low: you can swap or mock the composed object for testing and extend behavior without changing a class hierarchy. In Java, single inheritance limits reuse; composition composes behavior from multiple helper objects. Code example:class Reader { int read() { return 0; } }class Writer { void write(int v) {} }class FileHandler { private final Reader reader; private final Writer writer; public FileHandler(Reader r, Writer w) { reader = r; writer = w; } public void process() { int v = reader.read(); writer.write(v); }}<br><br>Supporting commentary: This shows how independent Reader and Writer are injected into FileHandler. Changes in Reader or Writer don’t force changes to FileHandler beyond the interface, and you can mock either for unit tests.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. What is the Difference Between ‘&gt;&gt;’ and ‘&gt;&gt;&gt;’ Operators in Java?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The interviewer checks your knowledge of bitwise operators, sign handling, and low-level behavior of integer types in Java.

Composition gives ownership: when the container is destroyed, the owned parts are also destroyed. For instance, a University composed of Departments implies that departments cannot exist without the university; a Department aggregating Professors implies that professors can associate with other departments or exist independently.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. How is the Creation of a String Using New() Different from That of a Literal?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Candidates need to know memory use, interning, and identity vs equality with Strings in Java.

If your code keeps references (for example, in a list or cache), objects remain live and the heap can fill. Infinite allocation loops that never drop references will exhaust memory despite GC. Example:List&lt;String&gt; list = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();while(true) list.add(new String("leak"));This loop keeps references, so GC cannot reclaim and OOM occurs.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7.
