The question was about dependency injection, and my brain just… blanked. I’d spent weeks memorizing syntax, but couldn’t explain how components actually talked to each other. That’s when I realized interview prep isn’t about cramming; it’s about understanding how things connect under pressure.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This post breaks down the most common Angular 6 interview questions components, services, directives, lifecycle hooks, forms, routing, RxJS, and more with short, direct examples and tangible takeaways—no filler, no theory dumps, just what you’ll actually face in the room.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you want to go beyond reading and start practicing the way I did before landing interviews at Amazon, Meta, and TikTok, Interview Coder’s <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">AI Interview assistant</a> lets you run mock sessions, get instant feedback, and tighten your answers until they sound like second nature.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Summary</h2><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Most Angular guides either put you to sleep or feel like someone asked ChatGPT to summarize the docs. I built this one the way I wish someone had handed it to me before my Amazon loop focused, no fluff, just what actually gets asked.</li><li class="text-gray-300">You’ve got to talk components and services like you didn’t just binge-watch a tutorial. The same goes for RxJS; if you don’t know the difference between a Promise and an Observable, especially when to cancel or chain them, you’ll get exposed fast. Interviewers love async questions because they separate “I followed along” from “I’ve shipped things.”</li><li class="text-gray-300">With lifecycle hooks, don’t stop at ngOnInit. Show them you know why setup goes there instead of the constructor. And if you’re ignoring ngOnDestroy, congrats, you’ve probably got memory leaks. They’ll ask.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Knowing when to break logic into a directive versus a component is one of those signals that tells them if you’ve worked on real apps or just built toy projects. And when they bring up forms? You’d better know when to use template-driven for quick stuff and when to reach for reactive forms if things get serious. You’ll want to show that you actually understand what FormBuilder gives you.</li><li class="text-gray-300">If you're just starting, focus on the 20 most common questions. But if you're past the junior stage, expect to get grilled on architecture, state, and runtime tradeoffs, not just basic syntax.</li><li class="text-gray-300">I used <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> to drill all of this. Mock interviews. Real-time coding. Brutally honest feedback. No fluff, just reps under pressure. It’s how I locked in Meta, then TikTok.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Read this like you’re prepping for a playoff game.

I had built three apps and thought I was ready. Spoiler: I wasn’t. They asked why Angular was created, and I froze like a React dev seeing two-way binding for the first time.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The truth is, you don’t get hired just because you can write working code. You get hired because you understand why things are built the way they are and can explain it under pressure.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This post isn’t theory. These are the actual types of questions I got when prepping for interviews at Meta, Amazon, and TikTok, and the answers I would give today.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let’s go.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. Why Were Client-Side Frameworks Like Angular Introduced?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Because manually wiring everything together in JavaScript got ridiculous.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Apps got bigger. Code got messier. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317637131_8_things_about_jQuery_which_makes_it_a_powerful_tool_to_write_rich_client_side_scripting" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Everyone was nesting jQuery</a> inside jQuery. You’d change one thing and break five. Frameworks showed up with a rule structure to help us not shoot ourselves in the foot.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why They Ask It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want to see if you understand the “why” behind the tech, not just how to use it.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Talk about scaling. Say something like “As web apps got more complex, frameworks like Angular helped enforce a pattern components, separation of concerns, routing so teams didn’t burn time fixing spaghetti.”</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Roy’s Tip</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use a Lego analogy. It’s dead simple. “Components are like Lego blocks. You don’t want to glue them together. You want to swap them in and out without the whole tower collapsing.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. How Does An Angular Application Work?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">High-level? Angular finds main.ts, runs bootstrapModule(AppModule), and renders AppComponent into index.html. That’s your entry point.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">From there:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">angular.json tells the CLI where stuff is,</li><li class="text-gray-300">main.ts spins things up</li><li class="text-gray-300">AppModule bundles all components.</li><li class="text-gray-300">AppComponent hits the screen.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why They Ask It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They're checking if you know how Angular initializes. Debugging weird startup errors starts here.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">List the files in order: angular.json, main.ts, app.module.ts, app.component.ts, and finally index.html.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Roy’s Tip</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Show you’ve actually debugged something before. Mention fixing a bootstrap array issue or a missing declaration once. That shows real-world experience.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. What Are Some Advantages Of Angular Over Other Frameworks?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Routing, HTTP, forms, and state are all baked in</li><li class="text-gray-300">Templates are HTML-based (no JSX mental overhead)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Google’s backing = long-term stability</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why They Ask It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want to know if you can evaluate tradeoffs. Not just parrot “Angular good.”</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Mention built-in tools and declarative templates, and explain why that saves dev time. Keep it concrete.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. Angular Vs React: What's The Difference?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Short version: Angular gives you everything. React makes you assemble it yourself.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Data Binding:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Angular → Two-way</li><li class="text-gray-300">React → One-way</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Dependency Injection:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Angular → Built-in</li><li class="text-gray-300">React → Third-party</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Language:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Angular → TypeScript</li><li class="text-gray-300">React → JavaScript</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Mobile Support:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Angular → Yes</li><li class="text-gray-300">React → Only with React Native</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Tooling:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Angular → Opinionated, built-in</li><li class="text-gray-300">React → Bring Your Own (BYO) everything</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t take sides. Say: “React’s great if you want freedom. Angular’s great if you want structure.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. Angular vs AngularJS?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This one’s easy if you’ve touched both.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Architecture: Angular uses components. AngularJS used controllers.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Language: Angular = TypeScript. AngularJS = JavaScript.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Mobile support: Angular works on mobile. AngularJS doesn’t.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Structure: Angular handles bigger apps better.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Syntax: Angular uses [ ] and ( ) for binding. AngularJS used ng-*.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why They Ask It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You might migrate legacy code. They want to know if you can handle that.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. How are Angular Expressions Different From JavaScript expressions?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Angular expressions:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Only access the local component</li><li class="text-gray-300">Can’t access the window</li><li class="text-gray-300">Are safer</li><li class="text-gray-300">Support pipes</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why They Ask It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re checking if you get how Angular avoids runtime surprises.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Roy’s Tip</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Show an example where JS would return undefined, but Angular just shows nothing. Makes it click.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s an app that loads once, then swaps content via JS and client-side routing. No full page reloads.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why They Ask It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">SPAs change how data loads, how <a href="https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">search engine optimization (SEO)</a> works, and how fast users see changes.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Roy’s Tip</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Mention tradeoffs: great UX, but SEO can be trickier, and first load time might suck.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. What Are Templates In Angular?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Templates = HTML with Angular sauce (like {{ }} for binding, *ngIf, etc.)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They live:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Inline (in the decorator)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Or in an external .html file via templateUrl</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why They Ask It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want to see if you understand where the view lives and how logic connects to it.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. What Are Directives?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Directives change how things appear or behave.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Component: Has a view. Every component is a directive.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Structural: Changes layout. Ex: *ngIf, *ngFor</li><li class="text-gray-300">Attribute: Changes appearance. You can write your own.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Roy’s Tip</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You will be asked about *ngIf. Know it cold.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Components, Modules, and Services: Explain</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Components = views + logic</li><li class="text-gray-300">Modules = group things together (can be root or feature modules)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Services = reusable logic or data fetchers</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">CLI makes all of these easy:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ng g c your-component</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ng g m your-module</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ng g s your-service</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Roy’s Tip</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Mention providedIn: 'root' for services to get global singleton behavior.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. What Is Scope?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is AngularJS-era stuff.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The scope was how AngularJS handled data binding and expression evaluation. Angular (the new one) replaced that with components and inputs/outputs.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Roy’s Tip</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If they’re asking this, they might still have legacy code. Mention that you're familiar but prefer component-based architecture.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. What Is Data Binding In Angular?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s how the component and template talk.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">{{}} — Interpolation</li><li class="text-gray-300">[property] — Property binding</li><li class="text-gray-300">(event) — Event binding</li><li class="text-gray-300">[(ngModel)] — Two-way binding</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Roy’s Tip</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Say which one you’d use in a real-world scenario. Ex: "For inputs, I use two-way binding via ngModel so I don’t have to manually sync the state."</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. What Is Two-Way Data Binding?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It's just combining property + event binding:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">&lt;input [(ngModel)]="username"&gt;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Any change to the username updates the input, and vice versa.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’ll need to import FormsModule in your module to use ngModel.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">14. What Are Decorators?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re metadata annotations with @ that tell Angular what your class is.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">@Component — this is a UI piece</li><li class="text-gray-300">@NgModule — this is a module</li><li class="text-gray-300">@Injectable — this is a service</li><li class="text-gray-300">@Input / @Output — data in/out of components</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15. What Are Annotations?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">In Angular, decorators replaced older annotation syntax. They do similar things, such as attach metadata to classes.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Most of the time, you’ll just be working with decorators now.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">16. What Are Pure Pipes?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re called only when the input changes by reference. Great for performance.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use them to format static-ish stuff like dates or currency.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">17. What Are Impure Pipes?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They run every change detection cycle, even if inputs don’t change.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You mark them like this:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">@Pipe({ name: 'something', pure: false })</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Only use these if you absolutely need to (like transforming data from a live stream or clock).</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. What is PipeTransform?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s the interface your custom pipes implement.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">export class MyPipe implements PipeTransform {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">transform(value: any, ...args: any[]): any {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">// do stuff</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’ll need to import it from @angular/core.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">19. How Do You Pass Data From Parent To Child?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use @Input in the child component.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">// parent.component.html</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">&lt;app-child [message]="someValue"&gt;&lt;/app-child&gt;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">// child.component.ts</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">@Input() message: string;</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">20. Typescript Class With Constructor And Method?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Easy:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">class InterviewBuddy {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">name: string;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">constructor(name: string) {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">this.name = name;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">greet() {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">return `Hey ${this.name}, let’s prep.`;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Real Talk</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Most devs prep syntax.

Angular 6 Interview Questions and Answers For Experienced</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I didn’t get into Amazon, Meta, and TikTok by memorizing every decorator and lifecycle hook in Angular. I got in because I knew how to explain tradeoffs under pressure, with code and words, not just definitions.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The truth is, interview prep content online? Most of it’s just regurgitated docs dressed up in Medium syntax. People copy-paste definitions like ngOnInit() and think they’re “prepared.”</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Spoiler: they’re not.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I made <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> because I got tired of watching brilliant engineers bomb interviews they should’ve crushed, not because they lacked knowledge, but because they had no system for thinking clearly under fire. These 30 Angular questions are not a cram sheet. They’re your script for sounding like someone who’s actually shipped Angular apps under deadline.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you're here to memorize answers, cool, but don’t stop there. Use these to build reflexes, not trivia recall.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. What’s the difference between AOT and JIT?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Real Talk</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This question isn’t about definitions. It’s about whether you’ve touched <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ci-cd-pipeline" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">CI pipelines</a> and know why bundle size matters.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">AOT compiles templates at build time → faster startup, smaller runtime, earlier error detection.</li><li class="text-gray-300">JIT compiles in the browser at runtime → faster iteration during dev, slower startup.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">When I Use What</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Local dev = JIT for speed</li><li class="text-gray-300">CI &amp; prod = AOT for safety and performance ng build --aot is your friend.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. What Does @Component Actually Do?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It wires your class to the DOM.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Adds metadata like selector, templateUrl, and styleUrls</li><li class="text-gray-300">Angular uses that to figure out how to render your stuff.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Think of it as the config file that tells Angular, “This class belongs on this part of the page, styled like this, using this <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327861224_Introduction_to_HTML_Hyper_Text_Markup_Language_-_A_Review_Paper" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a>.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. What are Services in Angular?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re how you avoid copy-pasting logic across components.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Marked with @Injectable</li><li class="text-gray-300">Usually singletons (if providedIn: 'root')</li><li class="text-gray-300">Injected via the constructor</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use them for data fetching, state management, caching, anything you don’t want tangled up in your UI code.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. Promises vs Observables?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Promise = 1 value, not cancelable, eager</li><li class="text-gray-300">Observable = many values, cancelable, lazy</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When I’m dealing with UI events, retry logic, or streams → Observable.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When I just need to fetch() something and move on → Promise.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Bonus: unsubscribe() saves memory. Don’t forget it.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. ngOnInit vs Constructor?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Constructor → set up fields, don’t touch bindings.</li><li class="text-gray-300">ngOnInit() → safe to fetch data, call services, etc.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I treat ngOnInit() as the "real" startup for components.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. How Do You Use *ngFor?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">&lt;li *ngFor="let item of items"&gt;{{ item }}&lt;/li&gt;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Bonus points if you mention trackBy for large lists to avoid rerendering everything when one item changes.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. Template-Driven Vs Reactive Forms?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Template-Driven</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Logic lives in the HTML</li><li class="text-gray-300">Easier for small forms</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Reactive</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Defined in the component</li><li class="text-gray-300">Better for testing, scaling, and complex validation</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">My rule: anything beyond basic inputs → go Reactive.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. What Kind Of DOM Does Angular Use?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Standard DOM, but optimized with change detection.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">It runs checks on data-bound expressions.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Use OnPush with immutable data for performance.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Avoid mutation when performance matters.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. How Do You Create Dynamic Components?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Use ViewContainerRef and ComponentFactoryResolver (or better: Ivy's createComponent)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Insert into ng-template</li><li class="text-gray-300">Set inputs after creation</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Clean up with componentRef.destroy() when you’re done.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. How Do You Debug Angular?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Angular DevTools for component trees</li><li class="text-gray-300">Chrome DevTools for breakpoints + network tab</li><li class="text-gray-300">Use console.log() or debugger when desperate</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I also log service inputs/outputs when tracing bugs across components.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. Angular App Is Slow. What Now?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Lazy load routes</li><li class="text-gray-300">Audit bundle size with source-map-explorer</li><li class="text-gray-300">Use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush</li><li class="text-gray-300">Compress assets, defer non-critical scripts</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Start with what loads first. Cut that down.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. Version Control Best Practices?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Use Git</li><li class="text-gray-300">Atomic, descriptive commits</li><li class="text-gray-300">.gitignore everything noisy (node_modules, dist)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Feature branches → Pull Requests → CI</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If your commit history looks like “fix”, “another fix”, “real fix” — redo it.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. How Do You Build A Custom Directive?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">@Directive({ selector: '[appHighlight]' })</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">export class HighlightDirective {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">constructor(private el: ElementRef) {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use Renderer2 if you care about SSR or want to avoid directly touching the DOM.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">14. MVVM in Angular?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Angular loosely fits MVVM:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Model = your data (from services)</li><li class="text-gray-300">View = templates</li><li class="text-gray-300">ViewModel = component class</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Data-binding keeps ViewModel and View in sync.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15. What Is The Bootstrapping Module?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Usually AppModule. It:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Declares your root component</li><li class="text-gray-300">Imports other modules</li><li class="text-gray-300">Kicks off the app via bootstrap: [AppComponent]</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Every Angular app starts here.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">16. What is Change Detection?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Angular checks bindings and updates the DOM.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Runs top-down from the root</li><li class="text-gray-300">You can optimize with OnPush</li><li class="text-gray-300">Manually trigger with ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Pro Tip</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">immutable data + OnPush = performance win.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">17. AOT Benefits?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Faster initial render</li><li class="text-gray-300">Fewer runtime errors</li><li class="text-gray-300">Smaller JS bundles</li><li class="text-gray-300">Better security (no template parsing in browser)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use ng build --aot in CI and prod.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. What are HTTP Interceptors?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They wrap <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/hyper-text-transfer-protocol" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a> requests/responses.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use them to:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Add auth headers</li><li class="text-gray-300">Handle global errors</li><li class="text-gray-300">Log traffic</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Register them with providers and set multi: true.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">19. What’s Transpiling?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Converts TypeScript to JavaScript</li><li class="text-gray-300">Done via tsc or Angular compiler</li><li class="text-gray-300">Generates source maps for debugging</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You write TypeScript, the browser reads JavaScript. That’s the bridge.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">20. What Is The Router State?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s the snapshot of the current route tree.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use ActivatedRoute to:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Get route params (route.snapshot.params)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Observe param changes (route.params.subscribe(...))</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Useful for breadcrumbs, nested routes, and guards.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">21. What Are Router Links?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">&lt;a routerLink="/home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Binds navigation to the Angular router</li><li class="text-gray-300">router-outlet renders the matched component</li><li class="text-gray-300">Add routerLinkActive="active" for styling</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use router.navigate() in code.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">22. Lifecycle Hooks?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Most used:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">ngOnInit → start logic</li><li class="text-gray-300">ngOnChanges → respond to input changes</li><li class="text-gray-300">ngOnDestroy → clean up (unsubscribe)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Others like ngAfterViewInit exist, but you don’t need all of them unless you’re doing DOM tricks.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">23. What Does The @Component Decorator Do?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It marks a class as a component.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Contains metadata:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">selector</li><li class="text-gray-300">templateUrl</li><li class="text-gray-300">styleUrls</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Angular reads this and wires up rendering.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">24. What Are Property Decorators?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They add metadata to class fields.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Common ones:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">@Input() → parent passes data in</li><li class="text-gray-300">@Output() → child emits events</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They control component APIs.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">25. Parameterized Pipes?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They format output.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">{{ birthday | date:'dd/MM/yyyy' }}</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">First param comes after :</li><li class="text-gray-300">Multiple params separated by colons</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used for currency, dates, decimals, etc.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">26. What Are Pipes?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They transform data in templates.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Built-in</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">date, currency, uppercase, etc.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Custom</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">implement PipeTransform</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">@Pipe({name: 'myPipe'})</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">export class MyPipe implements PipeTransform {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">transform(value: any, ...args: any[]) { return modifiedValue; }</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">27. What’s Dependency Injection?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Angular wires up services for you.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Use @Injectable()</li><li class="text-gray-300">Inject into components via constructor</li><li class="text-gray-300">Scopes controlled by providedIn</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You don’t need to do anything manually. DI handles the wiring.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">28. Observables vs Promises?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">We already did this. But here’s the fast rundown:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Values:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Promise → One</li><li class="text-gray-300">Observable → Many</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Cancelable:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Promise → No</li><li class="text-gray-300">Observable → Yes</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Lazy:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Promise → No</li><li class="text-gray-300">Observable → Yes</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Operators:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Promise → No</li><li class="text-gray-300">Observable → Yes</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">29. Interpolation vs Property Binding?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">&lt;!-- Interpolation --&gt;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">{{ title }}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">&lt;!-- Property binding --&gt;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">&lt;input [value]="title"&gt;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interpolation is shorthand for binding string values.

You could review some syntax sugar. Then you walk into the interview and they hit you with, “So… how’d you deal with XSS in that dashboard project?” And suddenly, all those flashcards don’t mean much.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I’ve tanked interviews by prepping like that. The kind where your Leetcode muscle is strong, but your real-world Angular recall is slow because you haven’t practiced talking through weird bugs or explaining why you picked one pattern over another.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This list fixes that.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Every question here comes from an actual scenario I’ve either:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Hit myself in real projects</li><li class="text-gray-300">Bombed in a real interview</li><li class="text-gray-300">Or used as the interviewer to test depth</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re aiming for senior roles or just tired of feeling rattled every time someone says "talk me through your architecture decisions," start here.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. What Happens When You Use &lt;Script&gt; Inside A Template?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Angular treats it like it’s radioactive. It strips it out automatically to prevent <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341155901_Cross-site_Scripting_Research_A_Review" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</a> attacks. You’ll get a warning in the console, and whatever you were hoping that &lt;script&gt; would do? It won’t.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">htmlSnippet = 'Template &lt;script&gt;alert("You are hacked !!!!")&lt;/script&gt; &lt;b&gt;Syntax&lt;/b&gt;';</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Angular sees this, removes the &lt;script&gt;, and just leaves the safe HTML. If you're binding with innerHTML, sanitize it or get burned.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. How do you include SASS in an Angular project?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When creating a new project:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ng new my-project --style=sass</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If the project is already created, change the default using:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ng config schematics.@schematics/angular:component.styleext scss</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This sets up all future components to use .scss instead of .css. Not hard. But easy to forget under pressure.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. How Do You Deal With Errors In Observables?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don't even try try/catch. That’s a rookie move in async land. Use the error callback.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">myObservable.subscribe({</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">next(val) { console.log('Next: ' + val); },</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">error(err) { console.error('Error:', err); }</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">});</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You can also use catchError in the pipe. Depends on the context.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. How Do You Share Data Between Components?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Multiple ways. Here's the quick rundown:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Parent to Child</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">@Input()</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Child to Parent</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">@Output() + EventEmitter</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Child to Parent (advanced)</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">@ViewChild()</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Shared Service</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Singleton pattern + RxJS subjects or signals</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you can’t explain when not to use a shared service, you’ll sound like you're just cargo-culting architecture.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. How Do You Pick An Element From A Template?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use @ViewChild. Works after ngAfterViewInit, or right away in signal-based apps.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">@ViewChild('inputEl') input: ElementRef;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ngAfterViewInit() {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">console.log(this.input.nativeElement.value);</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. When Should You Use An InjectionToken?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When your dependency isn’t a class. Config values, primitives, interfaces.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">export const API_ENDPOINT = new InjectionToken&lt;string&gt;('API_ENDPOINT');</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">providers: [</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">{ provide: API_ENDPOINT, useValue: '/api/prod' }</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use cases:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Configs</li><li class="text-gray-300">Third-party integrations</li><li class="text-gray-300">Anything you want the consuming app to plug into a library</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. What Are Resolution Modifiers, Really?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">These mess people up in interviews because the names suck. Here's what matters:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">self: Only look in the current injector</li><li class="text-gray-300">skipSelf: Start search in parent</li><li class="text-gray-300">host: Only look in the host component/directive</li><li class="text-gray-300">optional: Don’t throw if it’s missing</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Example</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Injecting NgControl only if it’s present on the current element:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">inject(NgControl, { self: true, optional: true })</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. What's The Point Of viewProviders vs providers?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you're using content projection (&lt;ng-content&gt;), this matters.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">providers = Available to content inside your component</li><li class="text-gray-300">viewProviders = Only available to your template, not projected content</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use viewProviders if you want complete control and don't want projected content screwing with your service instances.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Most people never touch this unless they're building component libraries or dynamic forms.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. When To Use Effect And Untracked In Signal-Based Apps?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use effect when you want to run something reactively but don’t care about returning a value.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use untracked inside the effect when you want to read a signal without making it a dependency. If you don’t, enjoy your infinite loops.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Focus input only when edit mode is on:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">afterRenderEffect(() =&gt; {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">if (editMode()) {</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">untracked(() =&gt; editInput().nativeElement.focus());</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">});</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Are Lifecycle Hooks Still Needed In A Signal-First App?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Not really. Most can be replaced:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">ngOnInit → constructor or effect()</li><li class="text-gray-300">ngOnChanges → computed()</li><li class="text-gray-300">ngAfterViewInit → viewChild() + effect()</li><li class="text-gray-300">ngOnDestroy → onDestroy() with DestroyRef</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Exceptions exist, but you’ll sound way more senior if you can explain this transition clearly.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. What Is A Higher-Order Observable?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An observable that emits other observables. That’s it.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The classic use case is a search box:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">search$ = control.valueChanges.pipe(</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">switchMap(val =&gt; http.get(`/search?q=${val}`))</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">);</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Different maps:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">switchMap: Cancel previous</li><li class="text-gray-300">mergeMap: Run all</li><li class="text-gray-300">concatMap: Queue them</li><li class="text-gray-300">exhaustMap: Ignore new if busy</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you can describe why you'd pick each, you're ahead of most candidates.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. What's The Difference Between share() and shareReplay()?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">share() → Shares a stream, but doesn’t cache the last value</li><li class="text-gray-300">shareReplay() → Shares and caches the last N emissions</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re seeing random re-fetches when navigating back to a route, you probably need shareReplay(1) and didn’t know it.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. What Does This Code Do? (scan() + expand())</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is the kind of code that either:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Makes a candidate shine, or</li><li class="text-gray-300">Makes them panic and pretend they "haven’t seen that pattern much"</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Use Case</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><a href="https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Power-Query/Dealing-with-paginated-API-using-Recursion-function/td-p/2132429" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Paginated API fetching</a> with recursive logic.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">expand((_, i) =&gt; (i &lt; 2 ? api.get(offset + 20) : EMPTY))</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">scan((acc, curr) =&gt; [...acc, ...curr])</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">expand() keeps calling itself until a condition fails</li><li class="text-gray-300">scan() builds up the full result</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Perfect for infinite scroll, but easy to misuse. If someone brings this up in an interview, they’re checking if you’ve worked beyond CRUD apps.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Final Thought</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Most candidates prep by cramming flashcards. Then they get a curveball like “Why did you use InjectionToken in that library?” and blank.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This list won’t save you if you don’t actually talk through these questions out loud.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s what <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> helps you do:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Record mock sessions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Get hints without breaking flow</li><li class="text-gray-300">Build consistency under pressure</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Try it free.
