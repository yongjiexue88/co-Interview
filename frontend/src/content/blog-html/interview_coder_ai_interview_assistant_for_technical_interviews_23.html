Your notes are a mess. You’ve got ten tabs open on LeetCode, half-finished flashcards, and a vague memory of that graph algorithm you swore you’d review. I’ve been there, overthinking every possible question instead of actually preparing with intent.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When I was prepping for my Amazon interview, I had no system, just chaos. That’s why I built a Technical Interview Cheat Sheet, something real engineers can actually use. It keeps things simple, must-know algorithms, quick time/space reminders, system design outlines, behavioral prompts, and a study plan that doesn’t burn you out.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">And suppose you want to practice with structure. In that case, Interview Coder <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">AI Interview Assistant</a> helps you run mock interviews, get instant feedback, and focus on the areas that matter most so you can walk into that interview calm, ready, and sharp.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What Is a Technical Interview? (Really)</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interviews were just about solving a few LeetCode problems fast enough to impress someone on the other side of a Zoom call. Turns out, that’s just the first layer.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/what-is-a-technical-interview" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">technical interview</a> is where companies stop reading your resume and start testing your instincts. They throw you into mock problems that look a lot like the stuff you’d see on the job, minus the Stack Overflow tab you usually keep open. It’s not just about writing code. It’s about how you think when someone’s watching, how you talk through tradeoffs, how you recover when things go sideways. And yeah, they will go sideways.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let’s break this down.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What Actually Happens in a Technical Interview</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’re not just writing code. You’re being watched for how you approach problems. That might mean:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Coding Challenges (Timed, Often Remote)</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Quick check on your <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/muscle-memory" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">muscle memory</a> for algorithms.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Live Coding (On Zoom Or Whiteboard)</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want to see how your brain works out loud.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">System Design</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Sketch out an architecture for something big, like Twitter DMs or a parking lot system. It’s less about buzzwords and more about reasoning.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Behavioral Questions</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Yes, this matters. “Tell me about a time…” will haunt you unless you prep.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Take-Home Assignments</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Sometimes you’ll get a mini project. They want to see if your GitHub commit messages are written by a human.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Each format has its traps. I’ve bombed them all at least once. But when you understand the signal each one is trying to pull, you prep smarter.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They’re Actually Looking For</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Forget the perfect solution. That’s not the point.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s what they’re watching for:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Can you ask the right questions before diving in?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Do you test your code or just hope it runs?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Are your solutions easy to follow, or some spaghetti you’ll never read again?</li><li class="text-gray-300">How do you respond when you get stuck?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interviewers aren’t looking for superheroes. They’re looking for teammates. People who can explain ideas, ask thoughtful questions, and get things done without creating messes for others to clean up.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Stuff You’ll Probably Get Asked</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I wish someone had handed me this list earlier. Expect questions like:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">What’s the most rewarding project you’ve worked on?</li><li class="text-gray-300">How do you estimate project timelines?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Explain how two-tier architecture works.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Walk me through a time you disagreed with a teammate.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Can you write a function to reverse a linked list? (Classic.)</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Plus The Usual</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming. For system design? You might be sketching a video platform or a messaging system on a whiteboard with 15 minutes to think and zero time to Google.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Prepped (Once I Got Tired of Failing)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s what actually helped:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">I made a daily checklist, a LeetCode system design sketch, and one behavioral story.</li><li class="text-gray-300">I practiced talking through my thoughts out loud, which felt awkward at first, but it saved me in interviews.</li><li class="text-gray-300">I started using mock interviews (real ones, not just staring at a mirror).</li><li class="text-gray-300">I built cheat sheets for code patterns and design principles, nothing fancy, just what I kept forgetting.</li><li class="text-gray-300">And yeah, I bombed a few before I got better.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you're still winging interviews with random YouTube videos and praying your resume speaks for itself... you’re doing it the hard way.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Quick Interview Prep Checklist (That Doesn’t Waste Your Time)</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Match 2 bullet points on your resume to each job description</li><li class="text-gray-300">Rehearse two project stories (with real numbers)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Solve three medium LeetCode problems under a timer</li><li class="text-gray-300">Sketch three system designs (on paper is fine)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Practice explaining a problem in 2 mins and 10 mins</li><li class="text-gray-300">Confirm your Wi-Fi, editor, camera, mic, and caffeine setup the night before</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Want a printable cheat sheet with actual patterns and real system design prompts?

data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Most Engineers Flop the Coding Round (Even Smart Ones)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When I was prepping for my first Big Tech interview, I thought I was killing it. Solved 200 Leetcode questions. Had a Notion full of “patterns.” Still got rejected. Twice. The problem? I was practicing like a student, not like someone about to be grilled on a whiteboard with sweaty palms and a 45-minute timer.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Here’s What Changed Everything</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I stopped memorizing tricks and started training like it was a sport, reps with intention, talking through my thought process, and owning my trade-offs. That mindset got me offers from Amazon, Meta, and TikTok, and it’s baked into how we built <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a>. If you’re tired of watching others get callbacks while you get ghosted, this cheat sheet is for you.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No fluff. No shortcuts. Just the stuff that works mainly under pressure.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Most engineers bomb technical interviews not because they’re bad at coding, but because they don’t train for real-world conditions. The goal isn’t just solving problems. It’s communicating clearly, thinking under pressure, and writing code that makes sense to another human. This cheat sheet will walk you through how I went from rejections to offers at Amazon, Meta, and TikTok, and how you can shortcut years of guesswork with a better prep system.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">The Real Interview Meta: What They’re Actually Looking For</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interviewers aren’t there to play code golf with you. They don’t care if your one-liner works if they can’t follow it. They want to know if you can solve real problems with real constraints, out loud, with tradeoffs that make sense.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s what matters:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Can you talk and think at the same time?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Can you bounce back from a bug without panicking?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Can you justify why you chose a HashMap over a set?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is what separates someone who “knows” algorithms from someone who gets hired.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If your prep doesn’t mimic this? You’re setting yourself up to fail.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">The Framework That Saved My Ass in Every Coding Round</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is what I run through on every single problem. It's not magic. It just works.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. Clarify The Question</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What’s the input? Output? Edge cases?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. Work On A Few Small Examples</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Think aloud. Interviewers want your thought process, not just your solution.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. Start With Brute Force</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t try to be clever too early. Earn your optimization.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. Improve it</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Show why your better solution is better. Talk about time/space tradeoffs.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. Write Clean Pseudocode</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t rush code until you’ve laid it out mentally.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. Implement Modular Code</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Readable &gt; clever.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. Test It Like You’re Trying To Break It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use significant, weird, and edge-case inputs. Talk through it.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s it. Miss one of these steps, and you’ll leave points on the table.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Mental Models That Keep You From Freezing</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When you’re stuck mid-interview, these are the go-to checks I use:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">What stays constant? (Invariants)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Can I turn this into index math? (Avoid fancy logic)</li><li class="text-gray-300">What’s the cost across a sequence of ops? (Amortized time)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Should I sort/hash/two-pointer/graph this? (Pattern matching)</li><li class="text-gray-300">What’s the time/space cost, and is it even feasible at scale?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Burn these into your brain. Write them down. Put them on a sticky note. Whatever it takes.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">DSA Cheat Sheets That Actually Matter</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You don’t need to memorize all of <a href="https://www.cs.arizona.edu/research/theory" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">computer science (CS) theory</a>.

The pressure’s weird, the questions feel like traps, and half the time you're not even sure what they're looking for. I’ve been there. Bombed early rounds. Froze mid-sentence. Typed nonsense while pretending to “think out loud.” So I stopped guessing and started treating prep like a sport with routines, reps, and review.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is exactly how I prepare now the same process I used to land interviews and offers from Amazon, Meta, and TikTok. Not theory. Not advice from some random career coach who’s never coded. Just what works.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Before the Interview: Prep Like You’re Tired of Wasting Time</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Build A Practice System: Not A Vibe</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t just “do LeetCode.” That’s how you waste 100 hours and still panic when asked to code a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921001690" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">graph traversal</a>.

Just a loop I can stick to. I also keep a doc that tracks:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">What question did I solve</li><li class="text-gray-300">What category</li><li class="text-gray-300">How long did it take</li><li class="text-gray-300">What I learned</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If I’m not improving, I can see it.

I’ve interviewed in a hoodie. No one cares unless you’re fidgeting every five seconds. Wear whatever lets you focus. If dressing up gives you a confidence bump, go for it. But don’t let your outfit become another thing you’re thinking about.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Your Intro Should Not Sound Like A Resume</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I’ve practiced a 60- to 90-second pitch that doesn’t make me cringe.

Just facts I can say without flinching.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I also prep 3–5 questions to ask at the end.

Nothing else matters.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Set Up Your Environment Like You’re Trying To Win</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s what I do 15 minutes before every virtual interview:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Close every tab not related to the interview</li><li class="text-gray-300">Set my phone to Do Not Disturb</li><li class="text-gray-300">Plug in wired headphones</li><li class="text-gray-300">Check my mic, webcam, and lighting</li><li class="text-gray-300">Open the coding environment they use</li><li class="text-gray-300">Prep a blank doc for notes</li><li class="text-gray-300">Keep a water bottle nearby.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No chaos.

Excited to work through this with you.”</li><li class="text-gray-300">“Thank you so much for the opportunity.” Not “I’ve always dreamed of working at XYZ.”</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Just chill and direct. Let your energy do the talking.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Ask Thoughtful Questions Before You Touch The Keyboard</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I always confirm:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Input type</li><li class="text-gray-300">Size limits</li><li class="text-gray-300">Whether values are sorted or unique</li><li class="text-gray-300">If I can change the input</li><li class="text-gray-300">What the expected output looks like</li><li class="text-gray-300">Whether null, empty, or edge cases are expected</li><li class="text-gray-300">Can I use standard libraries?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I also talk through a tiny example:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">“If input is [1, 2, 3], I’d expect output [6, 3, 0] is that right?”</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This avoids building the wrong thing for 20 minutes.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Through The Bad Ideas Too</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Even when I don’t have a good plan, I say something like:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">“Here’s the brute-force idea. It’s not efficient, but it helps me think.”</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Then I sketch it out and use it as a stepping stone to better ideas. I talk through time/space tradeoffs as I go, but I keep it fast. I want the interviewer to see how I think without falling asleep.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Ask Before You Code</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I literally say:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">“Unless you want to go deeper, I’ll start coding.”</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This lets them stop me if I’m going the wrong way.
