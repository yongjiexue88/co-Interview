What Is SQL?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">SQL stands for Structured Query Language. You use it to talk to relational database management systems such as SQL Server. It lets you fetch rows, insert new data, update existing rows, and delete data.<br><br>You also use SQL to define a schema, create tables, and control access through permissions. In practical interviews, expect questions about select, insert, update, delet, create table, and simple transaction control.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. What Are SQL Dialects? Give Some Examples</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">SQL dialects are vendor or product variations of the language. Each offers core SQL plus extensions and specific features. Examples include Microsoft SQL Server and its T-SQL extensions, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle SQL, and nonrelational systems that use query languages such as MongoDB’s query API. Knowing dialect differences helps when moving code between environments.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. What Are the Main Applications of SQL?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">With SQL, you create and alter tables, insert and delete rows, and update column values. You retrieve and summarize data with SELECT, aggregate functions, grouping, and joins. You filter and sort results, and you integrate SQL with languages like Python for reporting or ETL. In a junior role, you’ll use these basics to run reports, debug queries, and build minor stored procedures.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. What Is an SQL Statement? Give Some Examples</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An SQL statement is a command sent to the database engine. The engine parses, plans, and executes it. Common examples include SELECT for queries, CREATE TABLE to define a schema, INSERT to add rows, DELETE to remove rows, DROP to remove objects, GRANT to grant permissions, and REVOKE to revoke them. Interviewers often ask you to write or interpret these statements.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. What Types of SQL Commands (or SQL Subsets) Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">SQL commands group by purpose:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Data Definition Language (DDL) to define the schema</li><li class="text-gray-300">Data Manipulation Language (DML) to change rows</li><li class="text-gray-300">Data Control Language (DCL) to manage privileges</li><li class="text-gray-300">Transaction Control Language (TCL) to manage transactions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Data Query Language (DQL) focused on SELECT</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Each category maps to common interview topics like schema design, CRUD operations, and transaction handling.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. Give Some Examples of Common SQL Commands of Each Type</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">DDL:</strong> CREATE, ALTER TABLE, DROP, TRUNCATE, ADD COLUMN.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">DML:</strong> INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">DCL: </strong>GRANT, REVOKE.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">TCL:</strong> COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, SET TRANSACTION.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">DQL:</strong> SELECT</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interview tasks often combine these tasks, such as updating the schema and then running queries.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. What Is a Database?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A database is a structured collection of data stored in tables, indexes, views, procedures, and functions. It groups related objects and provides a controlled environment for storage, retrieval, and security. In SQL Server, this also maps to files, filegroups, and logical databases you manage with backups and restores.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. What Is DBMS, and What Types of DBMS Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">DBMS stands for Database Management System. It’s the software that stores, retrieves, and manages data. Types include relational, hierarchical, network, graph, and object databases. Relational DBMS, such as SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, are the ones interviewers expect you to know for standard SQL roles.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. What Is RDBMS? Give Some Examples of RDBMS</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">RDBMS means Relational Database Management System. It stores data in tables and uses keys to relate tables. It enforces ACID properties for transactions.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Examples:</strong></p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Microsoft SQL Server</li><li class="text-gray-300">MySQL</li><li class="text-gray-300">PostgreSQL</li><li class="text-gray-300">Oracle Database</li><li class="text-gray-300">MariaDB</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Expect questions about normalization, joins, and transactions in RDBMS interviews.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. What Are Tables and Fields in SQL?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A table is a set of related records organized in rows and columns. A field is a column in that table and defines the type of data stored. Tables hold data rows, and fields define the shape of each row, including constraints like NOT NULL or DEFAULT.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. What Is an SQL Query, and What Types of Queries Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An SQL query is code that accesses or modifies database data. Select queries retrieve data and can include grouping, ordering, and joins. Action queries change data or structure: CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and ALTER. During interviews, you may be asked to write both types and explain the effects on data and transactions.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. What Is a Subquery?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A subquery is an inner query placed inside another query’s clause, such as SELECT, FROM, or WHERE. The database evaluates inner queries first and uses their result in the outer query. You will see subqueries used to filter, compute aggregates per group, or provide derived tables for joins.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. What Types of SQL Subqueries Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Single-row subquery returns one row. Multi-row returns multiple rows. Multi-column returns multiple columns. Correlated subquery references columns from the outer query and executes per outer row. Nested subqueries are subqueries inside other subqueries. Knowing when to replace correlated subqueries with joins improves performance.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">14. What Is a Constraint, and Why Use Constraints?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A constraint enforces rules on table columns to maintain integrity. Constraints ensure valid data, prevent bad inserts, and keep relationships consistent. Typical constraints include NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and FOREIGN KEY. Interviewers expect clear examples of when to use each constraint to prevent data corruption.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15. What SQL Constraints Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">DEFAULT supplies a default value for a column. UNIQUE enforces unique values. NOT NULL forbids nulls. PRIMARY KEY combines NOT NULL and UNIQUE to identify rows uniquely. FOREIGN KEY links a column to another table’s primary key to enforce referential integrity.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">16. What Is a Join?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A join combines rows from two or more tables using related columns. Joins let you merge data from normalized tables for queries and reports. You’ll use joins daily for queries that pull customer information, orders, or related records for analysis.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">17. What Types of Joins Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">INNER JOIN returns rows that match join conditions in both tables. LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right. RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left. FULL OUTER JOIN returns rows from both tables, matched or not. Understanding each helps you control which rows appear in results.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. What Is a Primary Key?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A primary key is one or more columns that uniquely identify each row and disallow NULLs. A table can have only one primary key. Primary keys often drive clustered indexes in SQL Server and are critical for joins and referential integrity.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">19. What Is a Unique Key?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A unique key enforces uniqueness on a column or set of columns while allowing a single NULL in many systems. It ensures no duplicates, but does not carry the same identity role as a primary key. You use unique constraints to prevent duplicate business keys, such as email addresses.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">20. What Is a Foreign Key?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A foreign key is a column or set of columns that references a primary key in another table. It ensures that values in the child table are present in the parent table. Foreign keys are central to a normalized schema and prevent orphaned rows.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">21. What Is an Index?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An index is a data structure that accelerates row lookups, filter predicates, and ordering. Indexes reduce full table scans by providing quick access paths. In SQL Server, indexes use B-tree structures and can drastically alter query performance depending on design.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">22. What Types of Indexes Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Unique index prevents duplicates. A clustered index defines the physical order of table rows; a table can have one clustered index. A nonclustered index stores key values separately from the data and can be multiple per table. Knowing when to create included columns or composite keys affects performance and storage.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">23. What Is a Schema?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A schema is a namespace that groups tables, views, stored procedures, functions, and triggers. Schemas help manage permissions and organize objects inside a database. For example, dbo is the default schema in SQL Server.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">24. What Is a SQL Comment?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A comment explains intent to future readers and doesn’t affect execution. Single-line comments start with --. Multi-line comments use /* ... */. Use comments to clarify complicated joins, business rules, or temporary workarounds.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">25. What Is a SQL Operator?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An SQL operator is a symbol or keyword used to perform operations in expressions and conditions. Operators appear in WHERE clauses, joins, and calculations. Expect questions about comparison, logical, arithmetic, and set operators.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">26. What Types of SQL Operators Do You Know?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Arithmetic operators: </strong>+, -, *, /</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Comparison: </strong>=, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=</li><li class="text-gray-300">Compound assignment appears in procedural extensions</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Logical operators: </strong>AND, OR, NOT, BETWEEN. String operators include LIKE with % and _</li><li class="text-gray-300"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Set operators: </strong>UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT (or MINUS in some systems). Each has rules for NULL behavior.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">27. What Is an Alias?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An alias gives a temporary name to a table or column to simplify queries. You introduce it with AS, though AS is optional for columns.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Example:</strong> SELECT c.Name AS CustomerName FROM Customers c. Aliases make complex joins and derived columns easier to read.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">28. What Is a Clause?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A clause is a logical part of a SQL statement that controls behavior or filters results. Examples include WHERE to filter rows, ORDER BY to sort, GROUP BY to aggregate, HAVING to filter groups, and LIMIT or TOP to restrict row counts. You chain clauses in queries to shape output.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">29. What Are Some Common Statements Used With the SELECT Query?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Common statements with SELECT include FROM to indicate source tables, JOIN to combine tables, WHERE to filter rows, GROUP BY to aggregate, HAVING to filter aggregated groups, ORDER BY to sort, and LIMIT or TOP to restrict rows. Interview problems often require the right combination to get correct results.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">30. How to Create a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use CREATE TABLE to define columns and datatypes. Example:CREATE TABLE table_name ( col_1 datatype, col_2 datatype, col_3 datatype);</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Define primary keys, defaults, and constraints at create time to enforce integrity from the start.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">31. How to Update a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use UPDATE to change rows. Syntax:UPDATE table_nameSET col_1 = value_1, col_2 = value_2WHERE condition;Always include a WHERE clause to avoid updating every row. In SQL Server, you may combine UPDATE with JOINs or OUTPUT for auditing.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">32. How to Delete a Table From a Database?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use DROP TABLE table_name; to remove a table and its data. DROP is irreversible without backups. In interviews, candidates should distinguish DROP TABLE from TRUNCATE TABLE; TRUNCATE removes rows but keeps the table definition.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">33. How to Get the Count of Records in a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Use COUNT(*) to return the number of rows:</strong>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;Use COUNT(column) to count non-null values in a column. For large tables, consider indexed views or filtered counts for performance.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">34. How to Sort Records in a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><strong class="font-bold text-white">Use ORDER BY to sort:</strong>SELECT * FROM table_nameORDER BY col_1;Add DESC for descending order. You can sort by multiple columns and specify ascending or descending per column. Proper indexing can help with ORDER BY performance when the index matches the sort.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">35. How to Select All Columns From a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use SELECT * FROM table_name; to return every column. In production code, prefer explicit column lists to avoid unexpected schema changes and to reduce data transfer.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">36. How to Select Common Records From Two Tables?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You can use INTERSECT to return rows common to two SELECT results:SELECT * FROM table_1INTERSECTSELECT * FROM table_2;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Alternatively, use INNER JOIN on matching keys when you want specific columns or better control over joins and performance.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">37. What Is the DISTINCT Statement and How Do You Use It?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">DISTINCT filters duplicate rows from query results. Example:SELECT DISTINCT col_1FROM table_name;Use DISTINCT only when you need unique values; overuse can slow queries, and sometimes GROUP BY or proper keys are better solutions.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">38. What Are Relationships? Give Some Examples</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Relationships define how tables relate through keys. One-to-many is common; a customer table links to many Orders via CustomerID as a foreign key. One-to-one links two tables by shared primary keys. Many-to-many uses a junction table, for example, Products, Orders, and OrderDetails.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">39. What Is a NULL Value? How Is It Different From Zero or a Blank Space?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">NULL means unknown or missing data. Zero is a numeric value; an empty string is a valid text value of length zero. NULL propagates in arithmetic and comparisons and requires IS NULL or IS NOT NULL checks rather than equality operators.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">40. What Is the Difference Between SQL and NoSQL?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">SQL databases are relational and use predefined schemas with tables and joins. NoSQL systems are nonrelational and often schema-less, using document, key-value, column family, or graph models. SQL Server is a relational engine; choose NoSQL when you need flexible schema, horizontal scaling, or specialized query models.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">41. What Are Some Common Challenges When Working With SQL Databases?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Challenges include query performance tuning on large datasets, choosing and maintaining indexes, preserving data integrity with constraints and transactions, handling concurrent access with locking and preventing deadlocks, designing normalized schemas without over-normalizing, and optimizing execution plans and statistics for stable performance. In interviews, expect scenario questions about indexing strategies, execution plans, and basic troubleshooting.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Related Reading</h3><ul class="mb-6

Intermediate SQL Server Interview Questions</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. What Is a Function in SQL, and Why Use Functions?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A function is a named, encapsulated set of SQL statements that accepts parameters, performs calculations or transformations, and returns a value. Use functions to standardize logic, avoid repeated code, and keep business rules close to the data. In SQL Server, you’ll typically use scalar functions for single values and inline table-valued functions for result sets, but be aware that scalar UDFs can impact performance unless inlined.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. What Types of SQL Functions Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Functions are split into aggregate and scalar types, and into built-in versus user-defined. Aggregate functions operate on groups and return one result per group. Scalar functions operate per value and return a single result. The engine provides built-in functions; user-defined functions let you implement custom logic, but in SQL Server, choose inline TVFs when you need performance.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. What Aggregate Functions Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX, and COUNT cover typical numeric and row-count aggregates. Some engines offer FIRST and LAST but rely on ordering to be deterministic. Use COUNT(*) for row counts, COUNT(column) to exclude nulls, and grouped aggregates with GROUP BY to compute per-group summaries that feed reporting and business logic.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. What Scalar Functions Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Common scalar functions include LEN or LENGTH for string length, UPPER/LOWER for case conversion, INITCAP for title casing, SUBSTR or SUBSTRING for extracting text, ROUND for numeric rounding, and GETDATE or NOW for current timestamps. In SQL Server, prefer built-in, sargable functions when used in WHERE clauses to allow index seeks.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. What Are Case Manipulation Functions? Give Some Examples</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Case manipulation functions change string case:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">UPPER/UPPERCASE</li><li class="text-gray-300">LOWER</li><li class="text-gray-300">Functions that title-case values</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use them when normalizing user input, preparing display names, or performing case-insensitive comparisons when the collation does not already handle it.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. What Are Character Manipulation Functions? Give Some Examples</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Character functions include CONCAT, SUBSTRING, LEN, REPLACE, CHARINDEX or INSTR, LPAD/RPAD (or RIGHT/LEFT padding equivalents), and TRIM. Use them to build identifiers, parse CSV-like fields, remove unwanted characters before loading, or construct readable outputs from normalized data.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. What Is the Difference Between Local and Global Variables?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Local variables exist only inside the stored procedure, batch, or function where you declare them. Global variables exist outside those scopes and can be accessed more broadly; in many SQL Server contexts, global variables are system-level (like @@IDENTITY) rather than user-declared. Scope determines lifetime and concurrency behavior.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. What Is the Difference Between SQL and PL/SQL?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">SQL is the declarative language for querying and modifying relational data. PL/SQL is Oracle’s procedural extension that adds loops, conditional logic, and exception handling for business rules inside the database. For SQL Server, the equivalent procedural layer is T-SQL, which offers stored procedures, control flow, and error handling.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. What Is the Difference Between LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN mean the same thing; SQL allows the OUTER keyword to be optional. Both return every row from the left table and matching rows from the right table, with NULLs for non-matching right-side columns.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. What is indexing in SQL, and how does it improve performance?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An index is a data structure that speeds row retrieval by organizing key values and pointers to data pages. Proper indexing reduces full table scans and lowers IO. Indexes incur storage costs and slow down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations because the engine must maintain them. In SQL Server, consider clustered vs nonclustered, included columns, fillfactor, and statistics when tuning.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. What Is Indexing in SQL, and How Does It Improve Performance?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A stored procedure is a compiled set of T-SQL statements that can accept parameters, perform actions, return multiple result sets, and modify database state. Functions typically return a single value or table and are intended to be side-effect-free. Use stored procedures for transactional work, batching, and encapsulating complex workflows.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. What Is the Default Data Ordering With the ORDER BY Statement, and How Do You Change It?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ORDER BY defaults to ascending order. Add DESC to sort descending. In SQL Server, you can also specify multiple columns with ASC or DESC per column to control tie-breakers and deterministic results.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. What Set Operators Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">UNION combines results and removes duplicates. UNION ALL combines results, preserving duplicates, and is faster. INTERSECT returns rows common to both queries. EXCEPT or MINUS returns rows from the first query not in the second. Use UNION ALL for performance when duplicates are acceptable.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">14. What Operator Is Used in the Query for Pattern Matching?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The LIKE operator uses % for any sequence of characters and _ for a single character. Use LIKE for simple patterns; use full-text search or PATINDEX when you need advanced linguistic matching or performance on large text columns.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15. What Is the Difference Between a Primary Key and a Unique Key?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A primary key uniquely identifies each row and implicitly creates a unique index; it cannot be NULL. A unique key enforces uniqueness but allows a NULL (depending on the engine) and can exist multiple times per table. Primary keys are used for relationships and joins.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">16. What Is a Composite Primary Key?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A composite primary key uses two or more columns together to identify a row uniquely. Use it when no single column provides a unique identifier; otherwise, prefer a surrogate key for simpler joins and indexing.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">17. What Is the Order of Appearance of the Common Statements in the SELECT Query?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The standard writing order is SELECT – FROM – JOIN – ON – WHERE – GROUP BY – HAVING – ORDER BY – LIMIT. Developers format queries this way to improve clarity.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. In Which Order Does the Interpreter Execute the Common Statements in the SELECT Query?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The engine evaluates FROM (including JOIN and ON), then WHERE filters rows, then GROUP BY groups them, HAVING filters groups, SELECT projects columns and expressions, ORDER BY sorts, and finally LIMIT or TOP narrows the result set. Understanding this helps reason about when aggregates and aliases are available.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">19. What Is a View, and Why Use It?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A view is a saved query that presents data as a virtual table. Use views to encapsulate joins and filters, restrict column-level access, and provide a stable interface as underlying tables change. In SQL Server, use indexed views carefully since they materialize data and require maintenance.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">20. Can We Create a View Based on Another View?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Yes, nested views are allowed. Stacking multiple views increases complexity and can obscure inefficient joins or non-sargable expressions, making execution plans difficult to optimize. Keep nesting shallow and inspect execution plans when performance matters.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">21. Can We Still Use a View if the Original Table Is Deleted?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No. If the base table is dropped, dependent views become invalid and queries against them fail. Maintain object dependencies and use schema-bound opinions if you need protection from accidental changes in SQL Server.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">22. What Types of SQL Relationships Do You Know?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Common relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. Implement one-to-many with a foreign key on the child table. Represent many-to-many with an associative join table. Enforce referential integrity with foreign key constraints and consider cascading actions carefully.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">23. What Are the Possible Values of a BOOLEAN Data Field?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">PostgreSQL has a BOOLEAN with TRUE, FALSE, and NULL. SQL Server typically uses BIT with 1, 0, or NULL to represent boolean states. Choose types that match query patterns and storage needs.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">24. What Is Normalization in SQL, and Why Use It?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Normalization organizes tables to eliminate duplicate data and reduce update anomalies. Standard forms guide decomposition so each table stores a single logical entity. Normalized schemas simplify writes and enforce consistency, but may require more joins for reads.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">25. What Is Denormalization in SQL, and Why Use It?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Denormalization intentionally duplicates data to avoid costly joins and improve read performance. Use it when queries dominate the workload and latency is critical. Track update paths and accept the need for extra maintenance and careful indexing.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">26. What Is the Difference Between Renaming a Column and Giving an Alias to It?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Renaming a column changes the table schema and persists across sessions. An alias is a temporary name for display or downstream processing in a query. Use aliases to make results readable without altering production schemas.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">27. What Is the Difference Between Nested and Correlated Subqueries?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A non-correlated (nested) subquery runs independently and returns a value set used by the outer query. A correlated subquery references columns from the outer query and executes per outer row. Correlated subqueries can be less efficient and often convert to joins or apply operators for better performance.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">28. What Is the Difference Between Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A clustered index defines the physical ordering of table rows and is limited to one per table; a non-clustered index stores keys with pointers to the data rows. Clustered indexes benefit range scans on the key. Non-clustered indexes with included columns can cover queries and avoid lookups.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">29. What Is the CASE() Function?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">CASE implements if-then-else logic inside SELECT, WHERE, or ORDER BY. It evaluates WHEN conditions in order and returns the matching THEN value or ELSE if provided, else NULL. Use CASE to bucket values, compute conditional aggregates, or create custom sort keys.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">30. What Is the Difference Between the DELETE and TRUNCATE Statements?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">DELETE removes rows one at a time and logs each deletion; you can specify WHERE, and the operation is transactional and can fire triggers. TRUNCATE removes all rows by deallocating data pages, is minimally logged, is faster, and cannot be used when foreign keys reference the table. TRUNCATE resets identity metadata in many engines.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">31. What Is the Difference Between the DROP and TRUNCATE Statements?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">DROP removes a table and its metadata permanently, including constraints and permissions. TRUNCATE removes all rows but preserves the table structure and related permissions. Both are irreversible actions and require appropriate permissions.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">32. What Is the Difference Between the HAVING and WHERE Statements?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">WHERE filters raw rows before aggregation. HAVING filter groups after aggregation with GROUP BY. When an expression references an aggregate, use HAVING; otherwise, prefer WHERE for earlier pruning and better performance.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">33. How Do You Add a Record to a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (...) or INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2) VALUES (...). For SQL Server, you can also INSERT ... SELECT for bulk insert from another table, and use OUTPUT to capture inserted rows.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">34. How Do You Delete a Record From a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition. Include a precise WHERE clause or use transactions to avoid accidental full-table deletions. In SQL Server, wrap risky deletes in a transaction and test with SELECT first.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">35. How Do You Add a Column to a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Run ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype. Consider default values and nullability to avoid expensive updates on large tables. In SQL Server, add nullable columns first or add with a default using WITH VALUES when appropriate.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">36. How Do You Rename a Column of a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN ... TO ... in some engines. In SQL Server, use sp_rename 'table.oldname', 'newname', 'COLUMN' or use proper migration scripts that update dependent code and indexes.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">37. How Do You Delete a Column From a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name. Check for dependencies such as indexes, computed columns, or views before dropping to prevent runtime errors.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">38. How Do You Select All Even or All Odd Records in a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Test the remainder of the division by two. Use MOD(column, 2) = 0 in engines that support MOD, or column % 2 = 0 in SQL Server to select even rows. Adjust the predicate for odd rows accordingly.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">39. How to Prevent Duplicate Records When Making a Query?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use SELECT DISTINCT to remove duplicates in the result set, for data integrity, and enforce UNIQUE constraints or unique indexes on the table to prevent duplicates at the source.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">40. How Do You Insert Many Rows in a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use a multi-row INSERT syntax with multiple VALUES lists, or INSERT ... SELECT for bulk loading. In SQL Server, use bcp, BULK INSERT, or SqlBulkCopy for huge volumes to minimize logging and round-trips.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">41. How Do You Find the Nth Highest Value in a Column of a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ORDER BY column DESC with OFFSET n-1 LIMIT 1 (or TOP 1 with OFFSET in SQL Server) returns the nth highest by sorting. Alternatively, use window functions such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, or DENSE_RANK, partitioned as needed, and pick the row where rank = n for more apparent intent and better control over ties.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">42. How Do You Find the Values in a Text Column of a Table That Start With a Certain Letter?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use WHERE column LIKE 'A%' to match strings starting with A. If you need performance for large tables, add a left-anchored index or use full-text indexing for linguistic matching.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">43. How Do You Find the Last ID in a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use MAX(id) to find the highest value, or ORDER BY id DESC with TOP 1 in SQL Server: SELECT TOP 1 id FROM table_name ORDER BY id DESC. For recently inserted identity values, use SCOPE_IDENTITY() in the same scope.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">44. How to Select Random Rows From a Table?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ORDER BY NEWID() in SQL Server or ORDER BY RAND() in MySQL returns random rows; then LIMIT or TOP to restrict results. This approach can be expensive for large tables; prefer TABLESAMPLE or reservoir sampling techniques when efficiency matters.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Related Reading</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_47" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Cybersecurity Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_44" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Leetcode Alternatives</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_46" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">System Design Interview Preparation</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_45" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Ansible Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_48" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">LockedIn</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_39" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Selenium Interview Questions And Answers</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_43" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Git Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_37" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">jQuery Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_38" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">NodeJS Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_40" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">ML Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300">Front End Developer Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">DevOps Interview Questions And Answers</li><li class="text-gray-300">Leetcode Roadmap</li><li class="text-gray-300">Engineering Levels</li><li class="text-gray-300">ASP.NET MVC Interview Questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Deep Learning Interview Questions</li></ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11 SQL Server Interview Questions for Experienced Candidates</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1.
