It didn’t. What I really needed was a clear list of questions that actually come up, why they matter, and how to answer them without sounding like a textbook.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">So I pulled together the exact questions I got at Amazon, Meta, and TikTok, plus the ones my peers faced, and broke them down with the “why,” the real answer interviewers want, and quick tactics to prep.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. What are some real-life applications of clustering algorithms?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Clustering is like putting messy laundry into piles when you don’t know what’s clean or dirty yet. In machine learning, it helps you find patterns without labels.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Real-world use cases:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Grouping customers for targeted marketing (high-spenders vs one-time buyers)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Detecting fraud or anomalies in transactions or server logs</li><li class="text-gray-300">Compressing images by clustering pixel values</li><li class="text-gray-300">Segmenting patients by symptom profiles in healthcare</li><li class="text-gray-300">Auto-categorizing documents or support tickets</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When to use it:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’ll reach for clustering when you're trying to discover structure, not predict it. It's also helpful for feature engineering and reducing dimensionality before supervised learning.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. How do you choose the right number of clusters?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The classic: “How many clusters should I pick?” If you say “I just guessed k=3,” you're toast.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Smart ways to choose k:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Elbow Method: Plot WCSS vs. k, and look for the bend in the curve</li><li class="text-gray-300">Silhouette Score: Higher is better, aim for the peak</li><li class="text-gray-300">Gap Statistic: Compares your clustering against randomized data</li><li class="text-gray-300">Domain knowledge: Does it make business sense?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Stability checks: Rerun with different initial seeds. Are your clusters consistent?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interviewers love it when you mention multiple methods plus validation.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. What is feature engineering, and why does it matter so much?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This one separates the coders from the <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/ml-engineering-career-transition-guide/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">ML engineers</a>. Algorithms are cool, but features drive results.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Feature engineering means crafting useful variables that your model can learn from. It’s the art of turning raw data into gold.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Examples:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Time since last purchase</li><li class="text-gray-300">Ratio of income to debt</li><li class="text-gray-300">TF-IDF on text fields</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Why it matters:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A model is only as smart as the data it sees. Well-crafted features can drastically improve performance, even more than switching from logistic regression to XGBoost.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. What is overfitting, and how do you avoid it?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If your model’s getting 99% on training data but flunks the test set... yeah, you’ve overfit.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Overfitting = your model memorized the data instead of learning patterns.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Fixes:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Early stopping (especially in neural nets)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Regularization (L1/L2)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Prune decision trees</li><li class="text-gray-300">Cross-validation</li><li class="text-gray-300">Simplify the model</li><li class="text-gray-300">Dropout for neural networks</li><li class="text-gray-300">More clean, diverse data</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. Why can’t we use linear regression for classification problems?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Because it’s like trying to hammer a screw into the wall. Wrong tool.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s why:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Linear regression predicts continuous values, not probabilities</li><li class="text-gray-300">It doesn’t squash outputs between 0 and 1</li><li class="text-gray-300">You can’t threshold it reliably</li><li class="text-gray-300">The loss surface becomes non-convex for classification</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Instead, use <a href="https://www.eu-jer.com/logistic-regression-analysis-predicting-the-effect-of-critical-thinking-and-experience-active-learning-models-on-academic-performance" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">logistic regression</a> or other classifiers designed for discrete labels.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. Why do we normalize features in machine learning?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Because unnormalized features mess everything up.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Imagine using height in meters and salary in dollars in the same model, guess which one dominates?</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Benefits of normalization:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Faster gradient descent convergence</li><li class="text-gray-300">Fair feature weighting in distance-based models (KNN, KMeans)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Balanced updates in neural networks</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Common techniques:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">StandardScaler (zero mean, unit variance)</li><li class="text-gray-300">MinMaxScaler (scales to [0,1])</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Normalize first, then tune. Always.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. What’s the difference between precision and recall?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you're ever asked this in an interview, don’t just define them; give a real-world example.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Precision asks: Of all the alerts I triggered, how many were correct?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Recall asks: Of all the actual issues out there, how many did I catch?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Example:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">In medical diagnosis:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">High precision = fewer false alarms</li><li class="text-gray-300">High recall = fewer missed diseases</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’ll use the F1 score when you need a balance, especially in imbalanced data scenarios. Interviewers may also ask when to favor one over the other; know your use case.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. What’s the difference between upsampling and downsampling?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">These are ways to handle imbalanced datasets, but they’re not interchangeable.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Upsampling: Adds more samples from the minority class (via duplication or SMOTE). Helps with recall, but it can overfit.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Downsampling: Removes samples from the majority class. Reduces training time but risks losing signal.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Pro tip: combine both with cross-validation to keep your evaluation honest.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. What is data leakage, and how can you detect it?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Data leakage is the sneakiest way to accidentally cheat and get punished for it later.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It happens when your model has access to info it wouldn’t have in real life, like including “date of diagnosis” when predicting who will get sick.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Signs of leakage:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Validation scores are suspiciously high</li><li class="text-gray-300">Features correlate too perfectly with the target</li><li class="text-gray-300">Using future data to engineer features</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">To catch it: trace your feature pipeline. If something uses info from the future or target column, that’s a red flag.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Explain the classification report. What’s in it, and why does it matter?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’re not just training models for fun; you need to evaluate them.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The classification report gives you:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Precision, recall, and F1 score per class</li><li class="text-gray-300">Support (number of true samples per class)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Macro and weighted averages</li><li class="text-gray-300">Overall accuracy</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This lets you see how your model performs across classes. Especially important when classes are imbalanced. Don’t just say “my accuracy is 93%”, show how your model handles the hard cases.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Struggling to explain these metrics on the spot? <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">With InterviewCoder</a>, you can get live breakdowns of precision, recall, F1, and ROC AUC during your interview, so you never freeze on evaluation questions.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. What hyperparameters in Random Forest help prevent overfitting?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Random Forests are resilient, but not immune to overfitting, especially with deep trees.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Key hyperparameters:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">max_depth: Limits how deep trees grow</li><li class="text-gray-300">min_samples_split: Minimum samples needed to split a node</li><li class="text-gray-300">max_leaf_nodes: Limits tree size</li><li class="text-gray-300">max_features: Reduces variance by limiting features considered per split</li><li class="text-gray-300">min_samples_leaf: Requires more data at leaf nodes to avoid noise</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Tuning these makes your forest more reliable, especially on noisy data.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. What is the bias-variance tradeoff?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This one comes up constantly, because it’s central to machine learning.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Bias: Error from wrong assumptions (like using a linear model for non-linear data)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Variance: Error from being too sensitive to training data (overfitting)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The tradeoff: lower one and you often raise the other.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Your job as an ML engineer is to find the balance, usually with a mix of:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Model choice</li><li class="text-gray-300">Regularization</li><li class="text-gray-300">Cross-validation</li><li class="text-gray-300">More training data</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. Is an 80:20 train-test split always necessary?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Nope. That’s just a rule of thumb.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Better questions:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">How much data do you have?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Are you doing time-series modeling?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Do you have a class imbalance?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">For small datasets: use cross-validation. For big datasets, you might only need 5–10% as a test set. For time series: use time-aware splits, not random shuffling.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interviewers want to see you adapt your strategy, not repeat a rule.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">14. What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">PCA is a tool for reducing dimensionality while keeping the most variance.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Finds new axes (principal components) that capture maximum variance</li><li class="text-gray-300">Projects your data onto those axes</li><li class="text-gray-300">Helps with noise reduction, visualization, and faster models</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s especially helpful when your features are correlated or too many. But don’t forget: PCA is linear. For complex structure, check t-SNE or UMAP.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15. What is one-shot learning?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">One-shot learning is when your model generalizes from just one example per class.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Example: face recognition, you don’t need 100 photos of your friend, just one solid image.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Techniques:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Siamese networks</li><li class="text-gray-300">Metric learning</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use it when labeled data is rare or expensive.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">16. What’s the difference between Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Both measure distance differently:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Euclidean: Straight-line, “as the crow flies.”</li><li class="text-gray-300">Manhattan: Grid-based, like a taxi driving city blocks.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use Euclidean for continuous, dense data. Use Manhattan when the data is sparse or high-dimensional.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">17. What’s the difference between one-hot encoding and ordinal encoding?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">One-hot: Creates a new binary column for each category, no order assumed.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Ordinal: Maps categories to integers, implying order.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Colors? Use one-hot. Education levels (high school &lt; college &lt; grad school)? Ordinal makes sense.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. How do you evaluate a model using a confusion matrix?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The confusion matrix breaks predictions into:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">True Positives (TP)</li><li class="text-gray-300">True Negatives (TN)</li><li class="text-gray-300">False Positives (FP)</li><li class="text-gray-300">False Negatives (FN)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">From it, calculate: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s most useful for diagnosing which classes your model struggles with, especially if FN or FP are costly (healthcare, fraud).</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">19. How does an SVM work?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Support Vector Machines find the best boundary between classes.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Map data into higher dimensions (with kernels if needed)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Find the maximum margin hyperplane</li><li class="text-gray-300">Rely only on support vectors (the closest points to the boundary)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">SVMs are flexible but don’t scale well on massive datasets.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">20. K-Means vs. K-Means++: What’s the difference?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">K-Means: Randomly initializes centroids. Risk of bad clusters.</li><li class="text-gray-300">K-Means++: Picks smarter initial centroids by spreading them out.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use K-Means++ in practice. It converges faster and avoids ugly starts.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">21. What are common similarity measures in machine learning?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Cosine similarity: For text/high-dim vectors, focuses on angle.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Euclidean/Manhattan: For numeric data.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Jaccard similarity: For sets or binary features.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Choosing the wrong metric can wreck performance. Match metric to data type.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">22. Which handles outliers better: Decision Trees or Random Forests?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Random Forests.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A single tree might overfit to an outlier. A forest averages across many trees trained on different samples, so noise gets diluted.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">23. What’s the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">L1 (Lasso): Adds absolute weights. Encourages sparsity; some weights go to zero. Great for feature selection.</li><li class="text-gray-300">L2 (Ridge): Adds squared weights. Shrinks smoothly, keeps all features.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">ElasticNet combines both.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">24. What is a radial basis function (RBF)?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An RBF is a kernel measuring similarity based on distance.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Formula: K(x, x′) = exp(−||x − x′||² / (2σ²))</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used in SVMs, RBF networks, and clustering. It’s local: reacts strongly to nearby points, fades with distance.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">25. What is SMOTE, and how does it help with data imbalance?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">SMOTE = Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It generates synthetic samples by interpolating between a minority sample and its nearest neighbors.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Pros:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Reduces imbalance</li><li class="text-gray-300">Avoids naive duplication</li><li class="text-gray-300">Can improve recall</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Cons:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">It can amplify noise in the minority class. Validate carefully.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">26. Is accuracy always a good metric for classification?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No. On imbalanced data, accuracy can be misleading.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If 95% of your data is in one class, always predicting that class gives 95% accuracy, but no value.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Better metrics: precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC. Choose based on the real-world cost of errors.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Accuracy traps a lot of candidates in interviews. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">InterviewCoder</a> can walk you through precision-recall trade-offs in real time, helping you answer follow-ups clearly</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">27. What is KNN imputation, and how does it work?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">KNN Imputer fills missing values using the k nearest neighbors.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Steps:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Find neighbors based on available features</li><li class="text-gray-300">Fill the missing value with the neighbor average/median</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Better than global averages because it respects local structure. Scale features before using it.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">28. How does XGBoost work?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">XGBoost builds decision trees sequentially, each learning from the previous one’s residuals.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It uses:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Gradient boosting</li><li class="text-gray-300">Regularization</li><li class="text-gray-300">Tree pruning</li><li class="text-gray-300">Feature subsampling</li><li class="text-gray-300">Parallelization</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Result: fast and accurate, often among the top performers.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">29. Why do we split data into training and validation sets?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">To measure generalization without peeking at the test set.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Train set: Teaches the model</li><li class="text-gray-300">Validation set: Tunes hyperparameters</li><li class="text-gray-300">Test set: Final evaluation, use once</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Skipping validation risks overfitting and inflated scores.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">30.

K-Means vs. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): What’s the difference?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">K-Means: Unsupervised clustering. Finds groups in unlabeled data.</li><li class="text-gray-300">KNN: Supervised classification. Predicts based on neighbors’ labels.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">K-Means discovers structure. KNN memorizes and looks up labels at prediction time.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">32. What is Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction method.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Projects data onto axes that best separate class labels</li><li class="text-gray-300">Works when classes are roughly Gaussian</li><li class="text-gray-300">Helps simplify inputs for classification models</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Often used as a preparation step before training linear models.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">33. How can we visualize high-dimensional data in 2D?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Options:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">t-SNE: Preserves local neighborhoods, good for clusters, slower.</li><li class="text-gray-300">PCA: Linear, fast, captures global structure.</li><li class="text-gray-300">UMAP: Combines speed with local preservation.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Try multiple methods; visualization helps debug data, not just make plots.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">34. What is the “curse of dimensionality”?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">As dimensions grow:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Data becomes sparse</li><li class="text-gray-300">Distance metrics lose meaning</li><li class="text-gray-300">Models need exponentially more data</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Fixes: dimensionality reduction, feature selection, or simpler models.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">35. Which error metric handles outliers better: MAE, MSE, or RMSE?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">MAE: Best for outliers, treats all errors equally</li><li class="text-gray-300">MSE: Squares errors, outliers dominate</li><li class="text-gray-300">RMSE: Similar to MSE, still overweighting outliers</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Choose MAE when you don’t want significant errors skewed.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">36. Why is removing highly correlated features a good idea?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Redundant features:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Add complexity</li><li class="text-gray-300">Cause unstable coefficients</li><li class="text-gray-300">Inflate variance in linear models</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Drop one, or combine them. Cleaner inputs = better generalization.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">37. What’s the difference between content-based and collaborative filtering?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Content-based: Recommends items similar to what you liked, based on attributes.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Collaborative: Recommends based on what similar users liked.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Content-based is better for new users. Collaborative shines with rich user behavior data.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">38. How do you evaluate the goodness-of-fit in linear regression?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Metrics:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">R²: % of variance explained</li><li class="text-gray-300">Adjusted R²: Corrects for the number of predictors, provides a clearer picture</li><li class="text-gray-300">RMSE: Average prediction error in real units</li><li class="text-gray-300">F-statistic: Tests whether the model beats random</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Also, check residual plots for assumption violations.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">39. What is the null hypothesis in linear regression?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It usually states that a feature has no effect on the target.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Example: H₀: β₁ = 0 → This feature adds no value.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Reject H₀ with a low p-value; otherwise, it may just be noise.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">40. Can SVMs be used for both classification and regression?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Yes.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Classification: SVM finds separating hyperplanes.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Regression (SVR): Fits a function within an epsilon margin.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Both can use kernels for non-linear problems.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">41. What is weighting in KNN, and why use it?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">KNN can:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Treat all neighbors equally (uniform weights)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Weight neighbors by distance (closer = more influence)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Distance weighting usually improves accuracy when boundaries are fuzzy.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">42. What assumptions does K-Means make?</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Clusters are spherical and equal-sized</li><li class="text-gray-300">Features are on the same scale</li><li class="text-gray-300">Each point belongs to one cluster</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If violated, clusters become unreliable. Try DBSCAN or GMMs instead.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">43. What does convergence mean in K-Means?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Convergence happens when:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Centroids stop moving</li><li class="text-gray-300">Assignments stop changing</li><li class="text-gray-300">Variance within clusters is minimized</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Multiple random starts help avoid local optima.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">44. Why is tree pruning important in XGBoost?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Deeper trees memorize noise.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Pruning cuts branches that don’t improve performance. This achieves three things:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Limits overfitting</li><li class="text-gray-300">Speeds up training</li><li class="text-gray-300">Keeps trees easier to interpret</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">45. How does Random Forest ensure diversity in trees?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Two kinds of randomness:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Bootstrap sampling (different subsets of data per tree)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Random feature selection at each split</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This makes trees see different data, reducing variance when averaged.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">46. What is information gain in decision trees?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Information gain measures how much a split reduces entropy (uncertainty).</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The tree tests possible splits, choosing the one that creates the purest child nodes.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">47. How does the independence assumption affect Naive Bayes?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Naive Bayes assumes features are independent given the class.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Not true in practice, but it still works surprisingly well in text classification.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Strongly dependent features can skew probabilities, but in high dimensions, errors often cancel out.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">48. Why does PCA maximize variance?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Variance = information.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">PCA finds axes that capture the most variation in your data.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Helps with:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Dimensionality reduction</li><li class="text-gray-300">Noise removal</li><li class="text-gray-300">Faster training</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s linear, so use t-SNE or UMAP for non-linear data.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">49. How do you evaluate models on imbalanced datasets?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Accuracy fails here. Use:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Precision</li><li class="text-gray-300">Recall</li><li class="text-gray-300">F1 Score</li><li class="text-gray-300">ROC AUC</li><li class="text-gray-300">Precision-Recall curves</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Pick based on whether false positives or false negatives matter more.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">50. How does One-Class SVM detect anomalies?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">One-Class SVM builds a boundary around normal data in high-dimensional space.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Points outside that boundary = anomalies.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used in:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Fraud detection</li><li class="text-gray-300">Intrusion detection</li><li class="text-gray-300">Rare event monitoring</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Tune sensitivity with the nu parameter.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">51. What is “concept drift” in anomaly detection?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Concept drift = data distribution changes over time.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What was once “normal” no longer is. Static models fail here.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Fixes:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Retrain periodically</li><li class="text-gray-300">Use online learning</li><li class="text-gray-300">Monitor for drops in performance</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Concept drift is common in production; models need to evolve with data.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’ve got the knowledge.

class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When I was just starting out, machine learning interviews felt like a minefield. Not because the concepts were impossible, but because I didn’t know how deep to go or what they were really testing.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here are 10 essential ML questions every fresher should be ready for, plus how I’d answer them today, based on the lessons I learned landing internships at Amazon, Meta, and TikTok.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. What are the different kernels in SVM?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When you hear “kernel” in an interview, think: how do we separate data that isn’t linearly separable?</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Common kernels:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16094" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Linear kernel</a>: When data is separable by a straight line/plane. Often used for text and high-dimensional vectors.</li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016786552400254X" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Polynomial kernel</a>: Adds curvature, useful when feature interactions matter.</li><li class="text-gray-300">RBF (Radial Basis Function): Flexible non-linear kernel, often the default choice.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Sigmoid kernel: Mimics a neural network layer. Rarely used, but valid.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Custom kernels: Precomputed if you already have a similarity matrix.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interview phrasing:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“These kernels let SVMs handle non-linear data without explicitly mapping it, thanks to the kernel trick.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. Why was machine learning introduced?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Because writing if-else rules for everything doesn’t scale.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Machine learning lets systems learn patterns from data instead of relying on hand-coded logic. It powers spam filters, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and countless real-world applications.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">History note: Alan Turing’s imitation game planted early ideas about machines learning like humans.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. Explain the difference between classification and regression.</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Classification: Predicts categories (spam vs. not spam)</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Regression: Predicts continuous values (house prices)</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interview phrasing:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“I’d choose metrics based on the real-world cost of errors, like precision for spam detection or MAE for pricing.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. What is bias in machine learning?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Bias shows up in two forms:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Model bias: When the model is too simple to capture the pattern (e.g., linear regression on non-linear data).</li><li class="text-gray-300">Data bias: When the dataset favors one group unfairly (e.g., hiring data that reflects past discrimination).</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Strong answers mention both technical and ethical sides.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. What is cross-validation?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A way to test how well a model generalizes.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Steps:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Split data into <em class="italic text-gray-300">k</em> folds</li><li class="text-gray-300">Train on <em class="italic text-gray-300">k–1</em> folds, test on the last</li><li class="text-gray-300">Repeat <em class="italic text-gray-300">k</em> times, average results</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Why it matters: It gives a better picture than a single train/test split and helps catch overfitting.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Common setups: 5-fold or 10-fold.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interviewers often push beginners on overfitting and validation. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">With InterviewCoder</a>, you can get instant explanations of k-fold CV and model trade-offs while you’re in the hot seat.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. What are support vectors in SVM?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Support vectors are the training points closest to the decision boundary.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re the only points that affect the hyperplane; remove one, and the boundary shifts.
