My brain just… blanked. It wasn’t that I didn’t know BFS or DFS, I just couldn’t pull it together under pressure. That moment taught me something: <a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_64" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">coding interviews</a> aren’t about memorizing code; they’re about thinking clearly when it counts.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re serious about landing a big tech job, you’ve got to be fluent in the classics: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, recursion, dynamic programming, all that stuff. These are the building blocks that every interviewer secretly wants you to handle with calm confidence.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s why I built Interview Coder, an <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">AI Interview Assistant</a>. It helps you actually practice like it’s the real thing, targeted algorithm drills, instant feedback, and mock sessions that make you sweat (in a good way). Do this consistently, and walking into your following interview won’t feel like a panic test; it’ll feel like another rep at the gym.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Would you like me to make a version that’s slightly more SEO-optimized (e.g., includes “common algorithms for interviews” naturally a few times without sounding forced)? It’ll keep the same voice but improve keyword performance.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Summary</h2><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Most engineers think they’re decent at algorithms because they’ve watched a few YouTube videos or brute-forced LeetCode for a week. That illusion breaks fast when you're on a real screen and the interviewer throws something slightly off-pattern. I’ve seen it happen. Hell, it’s happened to me.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Here’s the reality: 70% of companies still ask algorithm questions. And not the kind you solve by memorizing a few tricks. You need to recognize patterns, make tradeoffs fast, and explain your thinking without rambling. If you can’t do that, you’re not ready, and no, solving 300 random problems won’t fix it.</li><li class="text-gray-300">When I was prepping for Amazon and Meta, what moved the needle wasn’t grinding endlessly; it was practicing the correct problems with time pressure and forcing myself to explain every decision I made. That’s precisely why I built <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a>. It mimics the stress of a real interview. It throws curveballs. It checks if you’re actually thinking or just regurgitating.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Because guess what? Tradeoffs matter. You should know when DFS is enough vs. when to reach for Dijkstra. Why does memoizing a naive recursive solution flip exponential time to linear? Why merge sort is safe, but quick sort bites you if the pivot sucks. That kind of stuff? It doesn’t come from flashcards.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Also, the data support this. Reflective practice beats raw volume. One study from Coding Interview 2025 showed a 50% bump in success for people who trained with structured reflection. And AI tools? Over 85% of users say they perform better with mock simulations, not because the AI is magical, but because it forces you to deal with uncertainty like a real interviewer would.</li><li class="text-gray-300">At the end of the day, it’s not about memorizing 100 questions. It’s about actually understanding 15 patterns, knowing when to use them, and being able to talk through your decisions like someone they’d want on the team. That’s the skill. That’s what <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/signin" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> helps you build.</li></ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15 Common Algorithms For Interviews (With Examples)</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I used to think I just needed to “know the algorithms.” Then I bombed a mock interview by freezing mid-sentence on a simple binary search variant. Not because I didn’t know it, but because I couldn’t explain why it worked in that specific use case.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s the truth: Interviewers aren’t grading you on memorized code. They’re watching how you think out loud under pressure. They want to know if you can choose the correct pattern and back it up with calm, clear reasoning, even if you're staring at a half-broken whiteboard in a room that smells like leftover pizza.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I built Interview Coder to fix that part. Not to help you memorize bubble sort again, but to practice deciding between patterns when the clock’s ticking. I’ve used this exact list to prep for Meta, Amazon, and TikTok interviews, and I make every candidate I mentor start with it.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">So here it is. No magic. No fluff. Just the 15 patterns that actually come up with notes on how to talk through them when it counts.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. Dynamic Programming</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You already know what this is, such as memoizing stuff to avoid repeating work. Most people think of it as some advanced technique, but it’s really just, “Did I already solve this? Then stop redoing it.”</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used For</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Knapsack, coin change, and Fibonacci</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Through</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What’s the state? What’s the recurrence? How are you caching?</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. Tree Traversal</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The tree’s not the hard part. The traversal orders are preorder, inorder, postorder, same visit, and different sequence.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used For</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Reconstructing trees, symmetry checks, and recursive problems</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Through</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What’s your base case?

Linear Search</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you bring this up in an interview, you'd better explain why you're not using something better.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used For</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Small arrays, unsorted data, fundamental cases</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Through</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Why is brute-force acceptable here? What’s the tradeoff?</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. Binary Search</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is the one pattern you must be able to explain in your sleep.

What does your loop guarantee?</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. Bubble Sort</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Not useful in practice, but it shows whether you understand what a swap is and when a sort can early exit.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used For</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Toy problems, first-round warmups</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Through</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Why is it inefficient? When does it finish early?</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. Insertion Sort</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It looks dumb at first until you realize it crushes on almost-sorted input.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used For</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Small input, hybrid sorts (e.g., TimSort)</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Through</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Why is it better than bubble?

If you ever need an O(1) lookup, your brain should immediately yell hash table.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used For</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Frequency maps, memoization, uniqueness checks</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Through</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What’s the hash function? How do you handle collisions?</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Depth-First Search (DFS)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You go deep first. Backtrack when stuck. People confuse it with recursion; it’s not the same thing.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used For</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Backtracking, topological sort, path-finding</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Through</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">How are you marking visited? Are you pre/post-ordering?</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is the shortest-path go-to when weights are equal. Always think of BFS when “fewest steps” shows up.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Used For</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Shortest path in a grid, level order traversal</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talk Through</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">What’s in the queue?

How Do You Figure Out Time And Space Complexity?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What they want</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You actually need to know what Big-O means beyond “O(n log n) sounds smart.”</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I do it</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Find the part of your code that loops hardest.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Count the steps with n.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Ignore constants unless they’re painful.</li><li class="text-gray-300">If it’s recursive, write the recurrence. If you can’t solve it, be honest and talk through your limits.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Heads Up</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They'll sometimes shift the input to something weird (like nearly sorted or huge-but-mostly-empty) just to see if you fall for the usual assumptions.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. Describe Linear Search</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They Want</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Do you even remember CS101, or are you copy-pasting from LeetCode?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Do It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Loop through, compare at each index, and return if it matches. Don’t overthink.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Gotcha</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Works fine unless you’re on a linked list or a stream, in which case your O(n) behavior suddenly isn’t so obvious.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. What Is A Sorting Algorithm?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They Want</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can you pick the right tool based on the input shape, memory, or stability requirements?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Do It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I default to quicksort unless told otherwise. If it's sorted chiefly, I say insertion. If memory sucks, I say heapsort.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Tip</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t explain the algorithm like a professor. Explain it like you're helping a junior dev who’s in a panic before pushing to prod.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. BFS vs DFS: What’s The Difference?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What they want</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can you map these to real problems, or do you just know the acronym?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Roy tip</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">BFS = shortest unweighted paths, queues.</li><li class="text-gray-300">DFS = topological sort, backtracking, stack (or recursion). Memory tradeoff? BFS eats more.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Trick Question Alert</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They may ask you to adapt one for giant graphs or limited memory. You should have thoughts on iterative deepening or bidirectional search.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. Write A String Reversal Algorithm.</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What they want</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can you swap stuff without making dumb off-by-one mistakes?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I do it</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Two pointers, one at each end —swap until they meet. Simple. If you mess this up, they assume your bug rate in prod will be high.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Twist They'll Throw At You</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Now reverse it in a language with immutable strings.” If you didn’t prep for that, congratulations —you just got cornered.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Fact You Should Know</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Candidates who practice algorithm problems with variation, not just solving, but re-solving with different methods, increase their pass rates by 50% (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424010339" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Coding Interview, 2025</a>). Most people grind LeetCode. The ones who get offers break their solutions on purpose to get better.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. What’s a greedy algorithm? When does it work?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They Want</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Can you prove it works? Do not just say "it works here."</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Do It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Mention the greedy choice property. Show one example (coin change or interval scheduling). Then give an example where greedy fails.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Watch Out For</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They'll ask you to switch from greedy to dynamic programming. If you panic at that pivot, you're toast.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. Swap Two Integers In Java Without Using A Temp Variable.</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They Want</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Bitwise skills or arithmetic tricks with safety in mind.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Do It</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">XOR method (classic), but I also mention overflow risk with a = a + b style. Then I say what I’d do in production (just use a temp, bro).</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Extra Challenge</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Immutable integers? Talk about boxing, language-specific quirks.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Mini-Rant</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When interviewers change the question halfway through? That’s not them being mean. That’s real life. They’re checking how brittle your prep is. Most candidates freeze because they’ve memorized scripts, not built flexible thinking. That’s why I built <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> to throw these pivots at you before they do.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. Explain Dynamic Programming. Give Examples.</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They Want</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You are not to fake it. Can you actually define state, recurrence, and transition?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Do It</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">State: what’s changing.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Recurrence: how states relate.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Memoization: if top-down.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Tabulation: if bottom-up.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Then I talk about real problems (knapsack, edit distance), not some abstract chart.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Extra Test</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They'll ask if you can reduce the space from O(n) to O(1). If you just stare at them, that’s a red flag.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. What Does A Hash Algorithm Do?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What They Want</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Do you get why we use hashing, not just “HashMap is fast”?</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Do It</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Map significant inputs to minor keys.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Handle collisions (and mention how).</li><li class="text-gray-300">Talk about when hash is good, and when it’s better to use trees.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Bonus</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Mention the difference between cryptographic and non-crypto hashes. You’ll sound like someone who reads docs.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Here’s The Part You Can’t Skip</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Most people think “solving problems” is enough. It’s not. You get hired because you adapt fast while being watched. Static prep doesn’t teach that. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> does.

It's the tool I wished I had when I bombed my first big tech interview. It sits quietly while you code, nudges you when you’re off-track, and helps you actually explain what you're doing without blanking out. Not some magic fix, just something that works when your brain short-circuits mid-interview.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">85% of folks using tools like this say they did better in interviews.
