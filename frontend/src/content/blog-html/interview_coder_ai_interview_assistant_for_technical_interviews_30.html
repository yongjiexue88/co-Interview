Not because I was lazy, but because I had no idea where to start. There were hundreds of problems, and every YouTuber had a “must-solve” list. I felt like everyone else had some secret roadmap, but I didn’t.<br><br>When I finally got serious about <a href="/blog/interview_coder_ai_interview_assistant_for_technical_interviews_64" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">coding interviews</a>, I built my own cheat sheet, just patterns that kept showing up again and again. Arrays, graphs, sliding windows, binary search, the greatest hits. That simple list ended up getting me through Amazon, Meta, and TikTok interviews.<br><br>So if you’re tired of bouncing between random Leetcode problems, here’s what actually works: focus on the handful of patterns that interviewers love. I’ll break down how I studied them, how Interview Coder’s <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">AI Interview Assistant</a> fits into that process, and how you can use it to run focused mock sessions and learn time/space trade-offs without overcomplicating things.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why I Keep a LeetCode Cheat Sheet Within Arm’s Reach</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Scrolling through endless threads or flipping between 10 tabs during interview prep is the productivity tax nobody talks about. Back when I was prepping for Amazon and Meta, I realized half my time wasn’t spent solving problems, it was spent trying to remember which damn pattern applied to what. So I started building a one-page cheat sheet. No clutter. Just the good stuff.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Not Everything Needs to Live in Your Brain</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You don’t need to memorize 300 questions. You need a system. My cheat sheet became that system. It lists go-to patterns (sliding window, BFS, DFS, etc.), complexity notes, and a few battle-tested code templates. It was my way of saying Hey, brain, let’s not waste <a href="https://study.com/learn/lesson/random-access-memory-ram-concept-types-uses.html" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Random Access Memory (RAM)</a> on boilerplate. I’d glance at it the night before interviews, or right before mock sessions. It made picking problems less random. Less guessing, more doing.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">I Don’t Like Mental Whiplash</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Jumping between a YouTube explainer, a Reddit thread, and a textbook just to remind yourself what “two pointers” means? That’s the stuff that burns you out. A cheat sheet trims the fat. You load it up once with patterns you actually use, and suddenly, things click faster. Less thinking about how to think. More time coding.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Keep It Nearby. Use It Often.</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When I was grinding LeetCode every night in college, I didn’t have time to “relearn” the same trick twice. I’d run short 10-minute review sessions using my sheet, just quick reps to keep stuff fresh. That helped me stay sharp under pressure. The less you hesitate in interviews, the more confident you sound, even if you're panicking inside. (Been there.)</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">The Real Win? Less Panic, More Progress.</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The point isn’t perfection, it’s predictability. A good cheat sheet keeps you focused on the 20% of stuff that matters 80% of the time. It gives your prep some structure. Daily skim, weekly mocks, repeat. The calm that comes from knowing you’ve seen this pattern before? That’s what gets you through the whiteboard round without melting down.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">My Go-To Cheat Sheet Format (and Why You Need One)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re walking into an interview without a cheat sheet, you’re not brave; you’re just winging it. And that’s fine if you enjoy sweating through a system design question because you forgot how BFS works. Me? I’d rather sweat from the treadmill, not from forgetting where I stashed my sliding window notes.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I keep mine broken into chunks that actually help:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Patterns (sliding window, backtracking, you get it)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Data structures and when to reach for them</li><li class="text-gray-300">Code snippets I’ve reused 50+ times</li><li class="text-gray-300">Common mistakes I’ve made (because trust me, you’ll repeat yours too if you don’t write them down)</li><li class="text-gray-300">A few “don’t be that guy” traps like forgetting to check for nulls or miscounting midpoints in binary search.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Everything is tagged. Difficulty. Frequency. When it last punched me in the face during a mock. I’ve turned my sheet into a personal graveyard of Ls, and that's precisely why it works.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What’s Worth Memorizing? (Hint: Not Everything)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Most engineers waste time polishing the wrong things.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re prepping for interviews, don’t scatter your time across obscure edge cases. Focus on where companies test. You’ll see:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Arrays and strings. Always.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Two pointers, sliding window. Learn the patterns once and keep reusing them.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Hash maps. For counting, grouping, and fast lookups, they’re everywhere.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Binary search. Don’t just know it, know when not to use it.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Graphs. DFS for connectivity. BFS for shortest paths. Know when to reach for each.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Stacks. If you don’t know how to use a stack for a monotonic problem, you will be by your third rejection email.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I mapped all these to LeetCode problems I actually got in interviews. Time is short. Use yours better.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What I Scan Before Every Interview (15-Minute Mental Warmup)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I don’t cram the night before. I skim my cheat sheet 15 minutes before go time.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s what I look at:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">List of patterns. Just the names. It jogs the muscle memory.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Runtime chart. It's not about showing off for picking the right approach under pressure.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Edge cases I’ve missed before: empty input, duplicate values, integer overflows.</li><li class="text-gray-300">A couple of templates. Binary search <a href="https://i.cs.hku.hk/~provinci/files/b2-programming_challenges.pdf" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Breadth-first search (BFS)</a>. Two-pointer merge. These are the kind of things I sketch on paper to get my brain moving.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s not about memorizing. It’s about showing up to the fight ready to fight.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What’s Always on My Sheet (Non-Negotiables)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I’m not saying copy me, but also don’t copy me. This is what’s helped me prep faster and better:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">One-liner Definitions</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">HashMap? A key-value store with average constant-time ops. Done.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Runtime Cheat</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Know what’s fast, what’s slow, and what’s risky if the input’s huge.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">1–3 Practice Problems Per Concept</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If I can’t connect a topic to a problem I’ve solved, I’m not ready.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Runtime Cheats I Actually Use</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Forget memorizing every runtime from every textbook. I keep it simple:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">QuickSort avg: O(n log n)</li><li class="text-gray-300">QuickSort worst: O(n²)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Binary search: O(log n)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Hash table insert &amp; lookup: O(1) average</li><li class="text-gray-300">Heap insert: O(log n)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Not for bragging.

You need a cheat sheet that actually thinks with you.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Mine had prompts like:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">“What’s the repeating subproblem here?”</li><li class="text-gray-300">“Am I solving from the top down or building from the bottom?”</li><li class="text-gray-300">“What time complexity are they really expecting?”</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I slapped that next to my most common patterns, reviewed with spaced repetition (Anki helped until it didn’t), and kept adding to it after every mock. By the time I got the Meta call, my doc wasn’t a cheat sheet. It was my brain on paper, the stuff I actually remembered and used when pressure hit. No fluff. No random formulas.

But talking out loud under pressure? Totally different sport. If you freeze the first time someone says, “Tell me how you'd optimize this,” you’re not ready.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Platforms like Pramp or Leetcode Mock Interviews are solid for this. I used them before every FAANG screen. Here’s what I’d do:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Pretend it’s the real thing (camera on, awkward small talk included)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Ask real clarifying questions</li><li class="text-gray-300">Narrate your thoughts even when they’re messy</li><li class="text-gray-300">Sketch on a notepad or text editor</li><li class="text-gray-300">Record yourself.

More problems. More tags. More grind.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">But real progress came when I stopped running from what I sucked at.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Go to Leetcode Premium. Sort by topics. Look for the ones where:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">You failed 2+ times</li><li class="text-gray-300">You took forever</li><li class="text-gray-300">You guessed your way through</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Make those your hit list. Build a set of ~15 questions around them. Mix in old ones too. Then track your re-do times. You’ll know you’ve leveled up when those slow, ugly solves turn clean.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Study Groups: Good Ones Actually Exist</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Most study groups suck. Too casual. No structure. Just people vibing on Discord pretending to grind.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The ones that helped me had rules:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">One person explains while the other pokes holes</li><li class="text-gray-300">You switch every round</li><li class="text-gray-300">Weekly sessions where you review clean code + common screwups</li><li class="text-gray-300">Pair sessions where you teach a pattern (because teaching exposes gaps)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Accountability is overrated if you’re the only one showing up.

People hoard 100 patterns and can’t execute any one of them cleanly when it counts.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Pick the ones that actually come up:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Two pointers</li><li class="text-gray-300">Sliding window</li><li class="text-gray-300">Binary search</li><li class="text-gray-300">DFS/backtracking</li><li class="text-gray-300">BFS</li><li class="text-gray-300">Topo sort</li><li class="text-gray-300">Union find</li><li class="text-gray-300">DP (yes, it sucks, learn it anyway)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Greedy</li><li class="text-gray-300">Trie</li><li class="text-gray-300">Bitmask</li><li class="text-gray-300">Prefix sums</li><li class="text-gray-300">Heap</li><li class="text-gray-300">Graph traversal</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">For each:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">One template</li><li class="text-gray-300">3–5 “gotcha” problems</li><li class="text-gray-300">One note: when to reach for it</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Put all of that into a cheat sheet you skim before interviews. No fluff. No quotes. No pretty colors. Just the stuff that saves your butt when the pressure hits.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Trained Without Burning Out (or Going in Circles)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let me keep it real, I used to bomb problems, stare at them for 40 minutes, then click “Run Code” like I was spinning a roulette wheel. Not proud of that phase. But once I stopped treating Leetcode like a slot machine and actually tracked my screw-ups, everything changed.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Keep a Brutally Honest Bug Log</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Every time I messed up, I wrote it down. Not just the link, I mean, why I failed, what my original logic was, what was broken, and the tiny test case that would’ve caught it. I had tags like “rushed logic,” “misread prompt,” and “forgot edge case.” After a week, you start to see patterns. That’s when you turn those patterns into flashcards or daily practice goals. My log wasn’t cut; it was just a Google Sheet and a case of brutal honesty.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Don’t Time Yourself Too Early: That’s a Trap</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Phase One Of Practice</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No timers. Just get the logic right. Write readable code, test edge cases. Pretend you’re explaining it to your future self, who’s had three hours of sleep.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Phase Two</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Then add time pressure. But even then, don’t turn into a speed junkie. I’d gladly spend 10 extra seconds writing a guard clause that saved me 20 minutes of debugging. Most of my dumbest bugs came from trying to “go fast.” Going fast without thinking clearly is fake progress.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Revisit the Stuff That Breaks You</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If a problem crushed me on Monday, I wasn’t done with it. I’d revisit it on Wednesday, again on Saturday, and then the following Friday, with the same idea or maybe a new variation. I’d make flashcards with one core insight or one trick that fooled me. Not for bragging rights, so that it wouldn’t blindside me again. Reps are how memory becomes instinct.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Build a Personal Cheat Sheet: Not Someone Else’s</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Forget those 10-page GitHub “Ultimate Cheat Sheets.” You need your own. Mine had like 15 lines of code and a bunch of angry red comments. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Depth-First-Search-with-recursion-and-stack_fig1_283335513" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">DFS recursion pattern</a>, binary search bounds, and sliding window edge cases. Stuff I kept screwing up. I looked at it before every mock like a boxer checking tape before a fight.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Steal Ideas from Leetcode Discuss: Then Make Them Yours</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I spent more time reading top answers than writing my own code. Not because I was lazy, but because someone already did the math on edge cases I didn’t think of. I’d bookmark the best ones, write my own version, and test it. I also posted my own write-ups. Half the time, someone smarter would reply with “you can do that in one line,” and I’d be like, “Oh.” Humbling? Yes. Helpful? Every time.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Shortcuts for Crunch Time</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I had mini-notes taped near my screen:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Array O(n), LinkedList: O(n), Tree: DFS/BFS = O(n), Graph = probably O(V + E)</li><li class="text-gray-300">Use a stack for monotonic, a queue for sliding window, and a hash map for counting.</li><li class="text-gray-300">If it’s about "shortest path," just try BFS first.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Those shortcuts saved me from sitting there thinking “uhhhh” during timed mocks. I didn’t memorize everything, but I remembered where to look.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Practice Schedule That Didn’t Break Me</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s what worked:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">60–90 minutes a day, 5 days a week</li><li class="text-gray-300">1 mock interview every Saturday</li><li class="text-gray-300">1 review session to fix logs, update flashcards, and yell at past-Roy</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s it. No all-nighters. No burning out. Just steady, boring progress that eventually made me... kinda dangerous.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Do the Boring Stuff That Actually Works</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">After you finish a problem, don’t just vibe your way to the next one. Take 5 minutes. First, write a short explanation as if you're talking to someone who understands the basics but missed this one. Keep it tight, no TED Talk.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Then, grab every dumb mistake you made, typos, off-by-one errors, wrong edge cases, and write a test that would’ve caught it. That’s how you stop repeating them like a broken record.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This isn’t some fancy system. It’s the stuff I did on a whiteboard in my dorm room. Boring? Yep. Repetitive? Also yes. But it works. That’s how you actually get better.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Questions That Hurt (But Help)</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Which three patterns punched you in the face this month?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Did you go back and actually fix that problem you flunked—or just move on and hope for the best?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Who’s giving you honest feedback this week? Not vague “good job” fluff. I mean, real stuff you can use. And what are you doing with it?</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If your answers make you uncomfortable, you’re probably on the right track.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Nail Coding Interviews with our AI Interview Assistant − Get Your Dream Job Today</h2><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Back when I was prepping for Amazon, Meta, and TikTok interviews, I hit this dumb loop: solve 300 LeetCode problems, still panic when the question looks even slightly different. Sound familiar? You build up this illusion of progress, but the moment the timer starts and someone’s watching, you forget the first for-loop of your "go-to pattern." Brutal.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s why I built <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> not as a “cheat” but as a pressure-tested sidekick. It’s the thing I wish I had back then: a quiet, behind-the-scenes assistant that feeds you patterns, edge cases, and complexity notes, all while you stay in flow. No pausing. No stalling. No awkward “uhh... let me think for a second.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">So What Is Interview Coder?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s not another practice site. It doesn’t throw more problems at you. It sits with you during real interviews and helps you think faster. Like a friend who hands you a sticky note mid-interview: “Hey, this one’s a sliding window. You’ve done this before.” That’s it. Simple help, right when you need it.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">It Doesn’t Make You Look Weird on Screen</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you're thinking, "won’t they notice?" nah. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/still_working" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> stays invisible while you screen share. It feeds you compact hints: “Don’t forget the off-by-one,” “Consider negative inputs,” “Here’s the test case they might ask next.” You keep typing. You keep talking. You still sound like you're just a sharper, calmer version.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">It’s Like a Smart LeetCode Sheet That Reads the Room</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Imagine having all your best notes, array patterns, DP edge cases, and graph templates, but with none of the scrolling or clicking. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/#pricing" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> organizes it all into instant, just-in-time nudges. The stuff you try to cram the night before? This time, it actually sticks.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">It’s Invisible. And That’s the Point.</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You don’t need someone talking in your ear. You need a confidence boost that doesn’t interrupt your flow. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/help" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> works quietly. Your code still looks like your code. Your thinking still sounds like your thinking. You just skip the part where you freeze on a dumb base case.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">87,000+ Developers Already Use It. That’s Not Hype. That’s Survival.</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">FAANG, Big Tech, startups, the people using <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> aren’t lazy. They’re smart enough to prep better. They want every edge, but they don’t want to sound robotic. This tool helps you prep smarter, present better, and actually land the thing you’ve been chasing.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Suggest You Start (Without Turning into a Tool Zombie)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Install it. Play with the pattern library. Use it in mocks. Let it help you learn, not just survive. If you only lean on it during the interview, you’re missing the point. Think of it like a training partner, one that doesn’t yell, just hands you what you need when it matters.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Related Reading</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2
