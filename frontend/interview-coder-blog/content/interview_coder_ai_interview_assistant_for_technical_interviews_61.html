class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. What Is AWS, and Why Do Companies Choose It?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">AWS, Amazon Web Services, is a cloud computing platform offering compute, storage, database, networking, analytics, machine learning, and many managed services.<br><br>Organizations pick AWS for its broad service catalog, global infrastructure of regions and availability zones, mature security controls, and strong partner ecosystem. Companies scale fast, pay for what they use, and accelerate development by offloading infrastructure management to AWS.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. What Are the Key AWS Components, and What Do They Do?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">EC2 provides on-demand virtual machines. S3 is durable object storage for files and backups. RDS manages relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MariaDB. IAM controls authentication and authorization. These components form the basic building blocks for most AWS architectures.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. What Is an EC2 Instance, and How Does It Operate?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">An EC2 instance is a virtual machine you launch from an AMI. You pick an AMI, choose an instance type for CPU, memory, storage, and networking, and AWS runs it on the physical host. You manage the OS and applications unless you use managed compute options like ECS Fargate.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. How Does S3 Differ from EBS, and When Do You Use Each?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">S3 is object storage accessed by API or HTTP, ideal for static assets, backups, and data lakes. EBS is block storage attached to EC2, suitable for OS disks and databases that need low-latency IOPS. S3 is globally durable and zone-independent; EBS volumes are tied to a single Availability Zone.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5.
