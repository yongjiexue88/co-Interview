I thought, “Cool, some questions about bots.” Then I walked in, and they hit me with UiPath workflows, debugging live scripts, and design questions that felt like mini-projects. I barely made it through the hour.<br><br>If you’re staring at the same <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/coding-interviews" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">coding interviews</a> invite, wondering how deep they’ll go into Automation Anywhere or Blue Prism, you’re not alone. These interviews aren’t just about knowing tools; they test how you think when things break.<br><br>So here’s what I wish I'd had back then: real RPA interview questions, model answers, scripting tips, and examples that actually prepare you for the room, not theory, not fluff.<br><br>That’s exactly what I built the Interview Coder <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">AI Interview Assistant</a> for. It gives you mock RPA questions, real-time feedback, and helps you practice until your explanations land clean. Think of it as your personal prep partner, one that doesn’t judge, just gets you ready to win the automation role.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Summary</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">I still remember bombing my first RPA interview. The recruiter asked about rollback plans, and I just stared at the Zoom screen like it owed me money. Nobody tells you that building bots is the easy part, explaining tradeoffs without sounding like a walking Jira ticket? That’s where people choke.</li><li class="text-gray-300">That’s why I built <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a>. It doesn’t just throw buzzwords at you; it makes you practice like someone who’s about to get grilled on real numbers, not your “passion for automation.” If a hiring manager hears “we saved 30% on ops costs” instead of “we implemented a bot,” you win. That’s the whole game.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Most RPA projects fail for dumb reasons, such as bad exception handling, no SLA fallback, or someone hardcoding a selector to a button that disappears. So I trained <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/still_working" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> to ask the same annoying governance questions your interviewer will. Better to sweat now than blank out when it counts.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Also, architecture questions are a trap. Everyone thinks it’s about tools, but it’s about tradeoffs. Do you surface it for speed? Or connect it for long-term sanity? <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/signin" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> forces you to explain those calls out loud because if you can’t explain it, you don’t understand it.</li><li class="text-gray-300">People who prep with us don’t just feel ready; they sound ready —real metrics, real structure, real reps. No fluff. 85% say they interview better after using it. 10,000+ got hired. No, it’s not magic. It’s just hard work, done right.</li></ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">25 RPA Interview Questions That Actually Show You Know Your Stuff</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. What Is RPA, And How Does It Differ From Traditional Automation?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Do They Ask</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want to know if you understand the basics or just memorized a definition.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer It Like A Human</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362035572_Robotic_Process_Automation_RPA_Adoption_A_Systematic_Literature_Review" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</a> refers to the use of bots to mimic human actions on a computer, such as clicking, copying/pasting, and data entry. Traditional automation usually needs code changes or API access. RPA just says, “Screw that. Let’s work with what’s already on the screen.”</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">RPA is software that mimics a person's actions on a screen to automate repetitive tasks. Unlike traditional automation, it doesn’t need to rebuild systems; it just clicks through like a human would.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. Can You Explain The RPA Lifecycle?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Do They Ask</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re testing how RPA is actually built and maintained.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer It Like Someone Who's Done This</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The lifecycle’s simple: plan the task, build the bot, test it, deploy it, fix it when it breaks (because it will). Then repeat because business rules change all the time.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“RPA is never ‘set it and forget it.’ You plan, build, test, deploy, and then maintain. It’s a cycle, not a checklist.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. What Are The Key Components Of An RPA tool?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Do They Ask</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want to know if you’ve touched a real tool or just read the brochure.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer It Straight</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">There’s the designer who builds stuff, the runner who executes it, and the dashboard where you watch things break in real-time.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Every RPA tool gives you a way to design the bots, run them, and monitor them. That’s it don’t overthink it.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. Describe A Scenario Where RPA Works Well.</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Do They Ask</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They're checking if you know when to use RPA (and when not to).</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer With A Real-World Lens</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Anything repetitive and rule-based is fair game, like invoice processing. RPA crushes that.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Think of invoice processing same structure, same logic, 1,000 times a day. Perfect for a bot.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. What Are The Benefits Of Using RPA?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Do They Ask</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want to know if you can explain the upside without sounding like a sales deck.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer Without Bs</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It saves time. It reduces dumb mistakes. It frees people from tasks they hate.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“RPA cuts down on manual work, reduces errors, and lets actual humans do less mind-numbing stuff.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. How Do You Handle Exceptions In RPA?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Do They Ask</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re testing if you can write bots that don’t fall apart when something changes.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer Like An Engineer</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Log everything. Try/catch the risky steps. Assume things will break and prepare for that.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“I wrap unstable steps in try-catch blocks, log every failure, and make sure someone gets pinged when stuff goes sideways.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. What’s The Role Of A Bot In RPA?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Do They Ask</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They’re checking if you get the basic mechanics.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer It Without Buzzwords</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A bot is just a script that acts like a person using a mouse and keyboard.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Bots are like super-obedient interns they follow instructions exactly, don’t complain, and don’t take coffee breaks.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. Difference Between Attended And Unattended Bots?</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Do They Ask</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They want to see if you understand how bots are deployed.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Answer In One Breath</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Attended = sidekick. Unattended = background worker.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Attended bots help humans during tasks, like filling forms. Unattended bots run in the background on a schedule no humans needed.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9.

Lock access down. Log who did what, when.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“I use encryption, role-based access, and audit logs.

That’s when I realized: RPA isn’t about building bots. It’s about building stuff that doesn’t break in the real world.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Fast forward, landing internships at Amazon, Meta, and TikTok didn’t happen because I memorized buzzwords. It happened because I got real about what breaks, why it breaks, and how to fix it. This post? It’s the exact list I wish I had before walking into those interviews.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let’s not waste time. If you’re interviewing for serious RPA roles, here are the questions that matter and how to answer them like someone who’s been through production hell and came out the other side.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. What Reasons Lead To The Failure Of RPA Projects?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Because people treat RPA like a weekend hackathon, they automate the wrong stuff — low-value screens that change every quarter — and skip the boring bits, like exception handling and real SLAs. Bots look fine at first... until things go sideways and no one knows who owns the rollback plan.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Real Talk Checklist</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Don’t automate junk. Start with stable inputs and decision rules.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Governance = versioning + rollbacks + incident playbooks.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Track the boring metrics: error rate, throughput, cost per transaction.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. What Are The Components Of RPA architecture?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Think microservices for bots. Split the brains (orchestrator), muscles (execution), glue (integrations), and logs (observability). Treat your bots like software, not side projects.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Breakdown</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Orchestrator: scheduling, RBAC, retries.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Execution: attended/unattended pools with autoscaling.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Adapters: APIs, queues, secure vaults.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Observability: logs, metrics, traces tied to biz outcomes.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. What is Citrix Automation?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s the automation version of flying blind. Your bot sees pixels, not DOMs. So you build with OCR, anchors, and prayers. Stability depends on how much you respect latency and visual noise.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Don’t Be Dumb</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Use OCR with anchors, not pixel clicks.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Add latency and fidelity checks.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Isolate to clean execution hosts.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. Chatbot vs RPA?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Chatbots talk. RPA does. They’re the frontend/backend of automation. Let chatbots capture structured intent, and let RPA handle the dirty work behind the scenes.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Pair Them Like This</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Chatbot: gathers user input and dumps intent to the queue.</li><li class="text-gray-300">RPA: picks up the queue, executes the process, and responds.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. Thoughts on RPA Recorders?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They're like scaffolding. Helpful in getting started, dangerous if you live there. Use recordings to bootstrap object models. Then rebuild it like a real app with tested modules.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What To Do</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Extract, parameterize, anchor.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Trash absolute selectors.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Build tests before you ship.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. What is Process Studio?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s your brain on canvas. If you treat it like a no-code toy, you’ll regret it. Treat it like an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ide/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</a> with rules, tests, and structure.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Clean Builds</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Modular by capability.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Add CI, linting, and code review.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Validate the five highest-revenue flows.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. What Is UiPath Studio?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s a legit IDE, treat it like one. Use packages, semantic versioning, and testing utilities; store artifacts in Git. Don't let your workflow become someone’s future headache.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Real Tips</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Shared libs? Version them.</li><li class="text-gray-300">No test = no deploy.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. How Do You Handle Exceptions In UiPath?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s not one try-catch. It’s a mindset. Every exception should either self-heal, escalate cleanly, or pause for human review with context.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Patterns That Save You</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Compensation flows.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Idempotent retries.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Clear escalation paths.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. Role Of RPA in Data Migration?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When systems don’t talk, bots bridge the gap. Use RPA for the human-in-the-loop parts of migration. Automate extract-transform-validate flows.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Keep It Sane</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Snapshots + verifications.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Dual-write with reconciliation.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Test harnesses everywhere.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Update Data In Two Apps Simultaneously?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You don’t. You coordinate. Use orchestration, staging, verification, and compensation. Assume one write will fail and plan for it.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Patterns</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Simulate 2-phase commit.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Queue-based retries.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Transaction logs.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. Latest File From A Folder In UiPath?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Sort by LastWriteTime, grab the first. Rename or lock the file before touching it. Run checks before you process anything.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Checklist</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Desc sort by timestamp.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Move to “processing” folder.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Validate + checksum.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. Calling Web/REST Services?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389636057_Handling_HTTP_Request_and_Response_Errors_in_Java_Web_Applications" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Use an HTTP client</a> with retries and schema validation. Auth goes in a vault. Failures need fallbacks. Don’t assume a happy path.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Real Setup</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">OAuth or mTLS.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Retry with jitter.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Validate responses.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. Why Use RPA for Email?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Because parsing inboxes manually is soul-killing. Use RPA for deterministic routing and extraction. Train it with ML if needed.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Templates + classifiers.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Extract + stage + verify.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Full audit trail.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">14. What’s The Automation Anywhere Control Room?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Your bot's mission control. Policies, deployments, telemetry. RBAC, scheduling, logs. Without it, good luck scaling.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Must-Haves</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Credential rotation.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Concurrency controls.</li><li class="text-gray-300">SLA dashboards.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15. When to use Intelligent Automation?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use it when volume is high, variance is real, and ML helps reduce grunt work. Not when you want to impress your boss with AI buzzwords.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Evaluation Grid</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Volume, effort, exception rate.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Real-world accuracy gain.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Compliance checkboxes.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">16. What Are The Risks Of RPA in Terms Of Security? How Are You Going To Deal With Them?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Bots are just as dangerous as people with bad passwords. Maybe worse. Assume they’ll be compromised someday. Plan accordingly.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Security Sanity Checklist</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Short-lived creds from a vault.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Tie every action to job + bot ID.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Lock bots into hardened segments.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">17. Surface vs Connector-Based Automation?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Surface automation = faking clicks. Connectors = speaking native API. If you can use a connector, use it. Save surface stuff for last resorts.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">When To Use What</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Connector = reliable and fast.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Surface = fragile, but sometimes your only option.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. Attended vs Unattended RPA?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Attended is your sidekick. Unattended is your night shift. Different use cases. Different risk models. Plan both like different species.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Execution Rules</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Attended = quick handoffs, local creds.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Unattended = orchestrator, strict RBAC, deep logs.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">19. UiPath vs Selenium?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Selenium is a sniper rifle. UiPath is a Swiss army knife. Selenium’s great for browser testing. UiPath owns the process layer.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Use Cases</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Selenium = testing and scraping.</li><li class="text-gray-300">UiPath = cross-app automation at scale.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">20. Screen Scraping vs Data Scraping?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Screen scraping = brute-force OCR. Data scraping = structured APIs/DOMs. Use the second. Fall back to the first only when stuck.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Tips</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Clean fonts before OCR.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Use selectors + OCR fallback.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">21. Mainframe vs Non-Mainframe Apps?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Mainframes are tanks. Non-mainframes are drones. They scale differently, fail differently, and need different automation hooks.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Automation Pointers</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Mainframe = emulators, stable screens.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Non-mainframe = API-first, async retries.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">22. Read and Write Activities in UiPath?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I/O modules need structure. Don’t just read/write. Validate, log, and retry. Build for idempotency so you can safely re-run.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Modular Structure</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Parse → Validate → Persist.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Schema checks, checksums, transactions.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">23. UiPath Architecture?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s not just Studio + Orchestrator. It’s the whole ops picture, such as CI/CD, DR, scaling, and alerting. Build for day 2, not just day 0.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Add These Layers</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">CI pipelines + package repos.</li><li class="text-gray-300">DR plans + DB replication.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Business-KPI-driven alerting.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">24. Process, Asset, Queue, Job?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Processes do. Assets store. Queues manage. Jobs run. Keep logic stateless and let queues carry state—version everything.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Tips</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Idempotent processes.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Queues = scaling + retries.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Jobs = log everything.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">25. What If The App Keeps Crashing?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Design like it will. Health checks, retries, snapshotting, and human fallbacks. Robots need a panic button.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Build Resilience</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Auto-restart scripts.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Diagnostic capture.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Escalation flows.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">26. Automate Dynamic Table Extraction?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Yes, but only if you respect timing, selectors, and loading patterns. Pagination and scroll detection matter.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Checklist</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Row anchors + smart waits.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Detect async loads.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Reconciliation checks.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">27. Process Requires Different Creds Per Stage?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Centralize creds. Inject them at runtime. Rotate often, track who used what, where, and when.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Cred Hygiene</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Scoped access per stage.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Rotate after X uses.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Audit trail by stage.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">28. Connect The Robot To The Orchestrator?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Register, assign, verify heartbeat. Script this via infra-as-code if you’re smart.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Sanity Checks</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Job scheduled?</li><li class="text-gray-300">License active?</li><li class="text-gray-300">Heartbeat stable?</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">29. Handle Dynamic Selectors?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use anchors and intent, not absolute trash. Wildcards only when they won’t explode later. Test them constantly.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">How To Stay Sane</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Store selectors in components.</li><li class="text-gray-300">CI health checks against staging.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">30.
