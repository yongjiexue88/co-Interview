The moment I got hit with a question about generators and decorators in a Meta interview, my brain went blank. I realized knowing syntax wasn’t enough I needed to think in Python.<br><br>If you’ve ever frozen mid-question trying to remember how list slicing works or when to use a dictionary over a set, you’re not alone.

Python Overview: Why I Still Use It Daily</h3><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Let’s Start With The Obvious One</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I learned Python because I was tired of staring at Java boilerplate, wondering if I actually liked coding. Python felt like cheating. But in a good way.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">It’s clean.</li><li class="text-gray-300">It’s readable.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">And it doesn’t make you fight the syntax before solving the problem.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s what makes Python the first language I recommend to anyone starting out (or switching teams):</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">It reads like English. Fewer curly braces. More actual logic.</li><li class="text-gray-300">You don’t have to declare types (until you want to).</li><li class="text-gray-300">You can debug stuff easily since it runs line-by-line.</li><li class="text-gray-300">The library support is insane. Want to mess with data? Pandas. Build a backend? Django. Do math that makes your brain hurt? NumPy.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Works on every OS, no drama moving between Mac, Windows, and Linux.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you're prepping for interviews, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373633075_The_Rise_of_Python_A_Survey_of_Recent_Research" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Python Programming</a> will not slow you down, which is precisely why I used it at Amazon, Meta, and TikTok.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. Lists vs. Tuples: Know When to Lock It or Leave It Open</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I messed this up in my first coding interview. Knew what a list was. Blank stare when they asked why I didn’t use a tuple.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s the breakdown, with zero fluff:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">List</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">You can change it. Add stuff. Remove stuff. Shuffle it all around.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Uses more memory, but that’s the tradeoff for flexibility.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Slower than tuples, but better when you need to mutate the data.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Comes with a ton of built-in methods.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a_list = ["Data", "Camp", "Tutorial"]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a_list.append("Session")</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(a_list) # Output: ['Data', 'Camp', 'Tutorial', 'Session']</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Tuple</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Locked. Once it’s made, it stays that way.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Faster to loop through. Less memory hogging.</li><li class="text-gray-300">Doesn’t come with all the list toys.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a_tuple = ("Data", "Camp", "Tutorial")</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(a_tuple) # Output: ('Data,' 'Camp,' 'Tutorial')</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re not changing the values, use a tuple. Otherwise, lists are your friend.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Also, check out our Python Lists guide, it’ll save you from small but dumb mistakes.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. What’s __init__() Really Doing?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Ah yes, the part of Python that makes it feel like real object-oriented programming.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Here’s The Real Talk Version</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When you make a new object in Python, __init__() is the method that runs automatically. Think of it as the function that sets things up, like giving your object its starting gear.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here's a small example, pulled straight from something I built during my internship prep:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">class book_shop:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">def __init__(self, title):</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">self.title = title</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">def book(self):</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print('The title of the book is', self.title)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">b = book_shop('Sandman')</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">b.book()</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># Output: The title of the book is Sandman</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What’s Happening</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">__init__() stores the title when the object is created.</li><li class="text-gray-300">book() is a normal method that just prints the title.</li><li class="text-gray-300">b = book_shop("Sandman") creates the object and runs the constructor automatically.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s it. Don’t overthink it.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s just your way of setting up the object’s internal state when it’s born.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. Mutable vs Immutable: How Python Handles Change</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When I was just getting started with Python, this tripped me up. I'd update one list, and somehow another variable changed too. I thought Python was haunted.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It turns out it’s just... mutability.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let me break it down the way I wish someone had explained it to me.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Mutable Types</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You can change them. They don’t mind.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Think: list, dict, set. They’re flexible, add stuff, remove stuff, edit in place.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># List</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a_list = [1, 2, 3]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a_list.append(4)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(a_list) # [1, 2, 3, 4]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># Dictionary</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a_dict['c'] = 3</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(a_dict) # {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Immutable Types</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Once you make them, that’s it. You want to change something? Python makes a brand new object.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Think: int, float, str, tuple.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># Integer</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a = 10</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a = 20 # New integer</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(a) # 20</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># String</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">s = "hello"</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">s = "world" # New string</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(s) # world</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># Tuple</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">t = (1, 2, 3)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># t[0] = 9 # Nope. TypeError.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(t) # (1, 2, 3)</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Mutable = “edit in place.”</li><li class="text-gray-300">Immutable = “copy, then change.”</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. Comprehensions &amp; Generator Expressions: One-Liners That Actually Make Sense</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Have you ever written a for loop that looks like five lines of boilerplate just to build a list?</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Yeah, same.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Then I discovered comprehensions, and suddenly I felt like a wizard.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">List Comprehension</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Take any iterable and spin it into a new list in one line.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">my_list = [i for i in range(1, 10)]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_list)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Cleaner. Faster. Readable.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Dict Comprehension</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Same idea, but for dictionaries.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">my_dict = {i: i**2 for i in range(1, 10)}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_dict)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, ..., 9: 81}</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Tuple “Comprehension”</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Spoiler: it doesn’t exist.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you wrap a comprehension in (), Python gives you a generator — not a tuple. If you want a tuple, you have to build one from a generator.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">my_gen = (i for i in range(1, 10))</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_gen)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># &lt;generator object&gt;</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">my_tuple = tuple(i for i in range(1, 10))</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_tuple)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don't get tricked by the parentheses. They’re not what they seem.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. GIL: Why Python Threads Don’t Really Thread</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let me save you the 6-hour debugging rabbit hole I went down.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">In CPython, only one thread can run Python code at a time. Yep. One.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-pythons-gil-global-interpreter-lock-prashant-patel-vlnjf" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)</a>. It’s like a bouncer guarding the CPU only one thread gets in at a time to execute Python bytecode.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">What this means</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">If you’re doing CPU-heavy work: multithreading won’t help.</li><li class="text-gray-300">If you’re doing I/O-bound stuff (network requests, file access): threads are fine.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># Threaded network calls = good</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># Threaded matrix multiplication = waste of time</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Starting with Python 3.13, there's a version without the GIL (PEP 703), and 3.14 is making it semi-official. But we’re still early. Lots of packages will need time to catch up.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Moral of the story: if your code is CPU-bound, go multi-process or async. Don't fight the GIL. It always wins.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. Searching &amp; Graph Traversal: Stuff You Actually Need to Know</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Interviewers love this stuff. And honestly? It’s kinda fun once it clicks.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s how I think about the main ones.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Binary Search</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Only works on sorted stuff.Cuts the search space in half every step.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># 0(log n) — efficient and clean</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">AVL Tree</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A tree that stays balanced. Always.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Whenever you insert/delete something, it does the math to keep itself from getting skewed.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">BFS (Breadth-First Search)</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Level by level. Good for finding the shortest path when everything costs the same.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Think: finding the shortest route in an unweighted maze.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">DFS (Depth-First Search)</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Goes deep down a branch before backtracking.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Good for:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">Maze-solving</li><li class="text-gray-300">Tree recursion</li><li class="text-gray-300">Cycle detection</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">A* Algorithm</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Intelligent pathfinding with a built-in sense of direction.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’ve played a game with an AI that knows how to chase you, it probably used A*.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. KeyError: Why Python Yells at You Over Missing Keys</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">So you try to grab a value from a dictionary using a key that doesn’t exist. KeyError.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It’s Python’s way of saying “That key? Never heard of it.”</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s how to deal:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. Use .get()</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Returns None (or a fallback) if the key isn’t there.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">my_dict = {'a': 1}</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_dict.get('b')) # None</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_dict.get('b', 0)) # 0</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. Use try / except</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">try:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">value = my_dict['b']</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">except KeyError:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">value = 0</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. Use "key" in dict check</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">if 'b' in my_dict:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">value = my_dict['b']</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I usually go with .get() unless I need to raise an error. Cleaner.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">More in our post: Python KeyError Exceptions and How to Fix Them</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. How Python Handles Memory: The Garbage Collector’s Behind-the-Scenes Magic</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Python doesn’t ask you to free memory manually. That’s nice.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Instead, it tracks how many references exist to an object. When that count hits zero? Time to delete it.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This is done via reference counting + a cyclic garbage collector for edge cases (like circular references).</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">import gc</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">gc.collect() # You can call this manually, but 99% of the time you don’t need to.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You can toggle it on/off with gc.enable() / gc.disable() too.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">But unless you're writing memory-critical code or benchmarking stuff, you can pretty much ignore this.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy: Because Python’s Sneaky Like That</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you're copying a list of lists and changes in one copy magically show up in the other — congrats. You've just met shallow copy.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s the breakdown:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Shallow Copy</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Copies the outer object, but not the stuff inside.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">import copy</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">shallow = copy.copy(original)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">shallow[0][0] = 99</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(original)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># [[99, 2], [3, 4]] — surprise!</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Deep Copy</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Makes a new version of Everything, even nested stuff.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">deep = copy.deepcopy(original)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">deep[0][0] = 42</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(original)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"># [[99, 2], [3, 4]] — untouched</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use shallow when your structure is flat.Use deep when you want complete separation and sleep at night.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">More examples python copy list what you should know</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Not gonna lie I slept on collections way longer than I should’ve. You know those moments where you're writing like 10 lines of defensive dictionary code just to avoid a KeyError? Yeah. Python had a fix for that years ago.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">When I finally got serious about FAANG prep, I started reaching for tools like Counter, defaultdict, and deque the same way I go for Ctrl+Z. They're just... better. Cleaner. Less try-except soup.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s one of my go-tos:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">from collections import Counter</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">data = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'a']</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">count = Counter(data)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(count) # Output: Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1})</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Could you do this without Counter? Sure. Do you want to? Nope. Interviewers notice when you skip boilerplate and just write clean, readable code. Use the tools.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. Monkey Patching: When You Want To Change The Rules Mid-Game</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This one's spicy. Monkey patching lets you overwrite behavior at runtime. Feels like cheating? Kind of. But sometimes it’s exactly what you need, especially in mocks, tests, or when the original code won’t cooperate.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s a simple example:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">class monkey:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">def patch(self):</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print("patch() is being called")</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">def monk_p(self):</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print("monk_p() is being called")</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">monkey.patch = monk_p # boom, replaced it</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">obj = monkey()</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">obj.patch() # monk_p() is being called</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Cool, right?

Everything ran fine until it didn’t. It took me hours to debug. It turns out, I was leaking file handles like crazy. That’s when I finally understood what I was actually doing.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">In Python, context managers exist to prevent you from messing things up. They're Python’s way of helping you handle stuff like files, locks, or DB connections without leaving a mess behind.

Coding Interview Questions (That Actually Came Up)</h2><div class="mb-8"><span data-media="image">[IMAGE 800x600]</span></div><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I didn’t learn Python in some fancy classroom. I learned it on the subway, cramming Leetcode on 2% battery, trying not to miss my stop.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This section? It’s what I wish I had back when I bombed my first Amazon interview because I blanked on __init__. Real questions. Real code. No filler.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let’s get into it.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">1. What __init__ Actually Does</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you’re still thinking of __init__ as just “that thing every class has,” let’s clean that up.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This method runs every time you make a new object. It sets stuff up. Think of it like the move-in day checklist for your object’s attributes.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">class Student:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">def __init__(self, fname, lname, age, section):</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">self.firstname = fname</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">self.lastname = lname</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">self.age = age</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">self.section = section</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">stu1 = Student("Sara", "Ansh", 22, "A2")</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Now stu1 has everything pre-packed and ready. Miss this step, and your object’s just wandering around with no ID.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">2. Arrays vs Lists: What You Actually Need to Know</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This one messed me up in an old-school screening. They asked why I’d use an array over a list. I gave a vague answer about “performance.” Yeah. Didn’t fly.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s the real difference:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Arrays</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Only same-type stuff allowed. Lower memory. Closer to <a href="https://study.com/learn/lesson/one-dimensional-arrays.html" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">C arrays</a>.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Lists</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Throw whatever you want in. Way more flexible, but costs you in memory.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">import array</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">a = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3])</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(list(a)) # Output: [1, 2, 3]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">b = [1, 2, "string"]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(b) # Output: [1, 2, 'string']</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Don’t pretend they’re the same. Know which tool fits.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">3. Making a Python Script Executable on Unix</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No magic. Just start your file with this:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">#!/usr/bin/env python</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That line tells Unix, “Yo, run this with Python.” Without it, you’re just typing in a .txt file pretending to be code.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">4. Slicing: Not Just For Lists</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Slicing is Python’s chillest power move. You’re telling Python what parts you want and how to skip.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(numbers[1::2]) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Syntax</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">[start:stop:step]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Defaults? Start at 0, go to the end, step by 1. You can slice strings, lists, tuples pretty much anything with order.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">5. Docstrings: If You’re Gonna Explain, Explain Right</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You ever read your own code a week later and go, “What the hell did I do here?” Yeah. Same.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Use docstrings.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">def add(a, b):</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">"""</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Adds two numbers and returns the result.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">"""</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">return a + b</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Multiline. Clear. For humans, not just for interviewers.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">6. Unit Tests: Save Future You From Debugging Purgatory</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The first time I broke prod, it was because I changed something in one part of the code and didn’t realize I nuked everything downstream.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Unit tests are how you stop that.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">They don’t check if the whole app works. They check if this tiny thing does what it’s supposed to. That way, when something breaks, you don’t have to play detective for three hours.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’ll use <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314120014_Python_Unit_Test_Automation" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Python’s unittest module</a>, or sometimes pytest if you’re feeling fancy. But the idea’s the same: break your code into pieces and check each piece like it’s guilty until proven innocent.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">7. break, continue, and pass: How I Actually Remembered What They Do</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Let’s be real. The first time I saw break, continue, and pass in someone’s code, I stared at it like it was a cryptic message from a senior dev trying to haze me. I fumbled through it during my Amazon internship prep and kept mixing up continue and break like a clown. Here's how I finally got it straight:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">break</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Yeets you out of the loop immediately.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">continue</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Skips the rest of the loop and jumps to the next item.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">pass</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Basically, a shrug, it’s Python going “eh, I’ll deal with this later.”</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s a quick example I actually messed around with during prep. This one stuck:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">pat = [1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">for p in pat:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">pass # placeholder because I wasn’t sure what to put here initially</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">if (p == 0):</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">current = p</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">break</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">elif (p % 2 == 0):</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">continue</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(p) # output =&gt; 1 3 1 3 1</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(current) # output =&gt; 0</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Moral of the story Use pass when your code isn’t ready. Use continue when you're picky. Use break when you're done pretending you care.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">8. self in Python: Yeah, It's Not a Keyword: But You’ll Use It Like One</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I used to think self was a Python keyword. It’s not. But honestly, it might as well be because every time you're working with a class, it’s showing up uninvited.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s how I think about it: self is just a way for the class to keep track of itself. Like:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">“Hey, I’m this specific object, not one of those other ones.”</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’ll use it to access attributes and methods inside the class. It’s like giving your code a mirror and saying, “Yeah, that’s me.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">9. Global vs Protected vs Private: Or... How Much Should You Trust Other Devs?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Okay, this one took me forever to wrap my head around, mostly because Python is way too chill about access control.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Global</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Just... don’t. Avoid unless you have a good reason.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Protected (_var)</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Basically saying, “Please don’t touch this.” But Python won’t stop anyone.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Private (__var)</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">A little more strict. Try accessing it, and Python throws shade at you. But you can still access it using some weird syntax if you’re stubborn.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you're building something serious, respect the double underscores. But in most interviews, just show that you know why you'd use them, not that you're memorizing rules like a robot.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">10. Modules and Packages: Yes, You Should Split Your Code</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You ever scroll through a 500-line Python file and wonder why your brain hurts?</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s why modules exist.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s the version I wish someone had told me earlier:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">A module is just a .py file. That’s it.</li><li class="text-gray-300">A package is a folder with a bunch of those .py files.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You can import the whole thing or just grab what you need:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">from my_utils import format_money</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It keeps your code clean-ish and your brain from melting. Bonus: You’ll look organized during your interview screen share.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">11. Pass Again? Yep: Because Python Throws A Fit Without It</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Look, sometimes you’ve got a function or class or loop... and no idea what to put inside it yet.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Try this:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">def to_be_written_later():</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">pass</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s it. Without a pass, Python just starts yelling about indentation. With it? Silence. Glorious, quiet, judgment-free silence.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">12. Built-in Data Types: Know These, Or Cry in Your Coding Interview</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I didn’t take Python seriously until I bombed a warm-up round because I forgot how frozenset worked. Lesson learned.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s the short version of what you actually need to care about:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">None Type</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">None is Python’s version of “nothing to see here.”</li><li class="text-gray-300">Use it to initialize stuff or return when there’s no result.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Numeric Types</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">int, float, complex, bool</li><li class="text-gray-300">Reminder: True is just 1, and False is 0. Weird but useful.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Sequence Types</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">list: Your go-to. Mutable. Use it 90% of the time.</li><li class="text-gray-300">tuple: Same as a list, but locked down. Good for fixed data.</li><li class="text-gray-300">range: Lightweight number generator for loops.</li><li class="text-gray-300">str: Strings, obviously.</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Strings are immutable. You change one letter, you're copying the whole thing.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Mapping Types</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">dict: Key-value pairs. You’ll use this everywhere. Probably way more than you should.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Set Types</h4><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">set: Unordered, no duplicates, super fast lookup.</li><li class="text-gray-300">frozenset: Same but frozen. Interviewers love asking this for no reason.</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Modules</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Python files that can be imported. You already do this with stuff like math or random.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Callable Types</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Anything you can slap () on and it runs. Functions, methods, and even some classes.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you remember nothing else, at least get comfortable with list, dict, and str. Everything else is seasoning.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">13. Lists vs. Tuples: The Mutability Thing No One Tells You</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I remember messing this up during an internship coding challenge. Changed a tuple, thinking it was a list. Broke half the test cases. Classic.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Anyway, here’s the deal: lists can change, tuples can’t. That’s really the whole point. Python gives you two ways to store sequences, and they look similar at first glance, but they behave entirely differently.</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">A list is written like this: ['sara', 6, 0.19]</li><li class="text-gray-300">A tuple looks like this: ('ansh', 5, 0.97)</li></ul><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Now here’s where beginners get wrecked:</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">my_tuple = ('sara', 6, 5, 0.97)</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">my_list = ['sara', 6, 5, 0.97]</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_tuple[0]) # 'sara'</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_list[0]) # 'sara'</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">my_tuple[0] = 'ansh' # throws TypeError</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">my_list[0] = 'ansh' # no problem</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_tuple[0]) # still 'sara'</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">print(my_list[0]) # now 'ansh'</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">So when should you use which? Use a list when your data is gonna change, like user input, mutable configs, etc. Use a tuple when your data should stay locked, like fixed options, constants, or keys in a dictionary.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">That’s it. No need to overthink it.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">14. Scope in Python: Or Why Your Variables Disappear</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Python’s got this invisible fence thing going on. Every variable you declare lives somewhere, but not everywhere. I’ve lost hours wondering why my variable wasn’t doing what I thought; turns out it was living in the wrong “scope.”</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s how I think about it:</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Local Scope</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">lives inside the function</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Global Scope</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">lives across the whole file</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Module-Level Scope</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">global inside a specific module</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Built-In Scope</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Python’s own stuff (like len() or range())</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">And yeah, they all play nice… until they don’t. If you try to change a global variable from inside a function, Python just creates a new local one unless you explicitly say global. Ask me how I found that out.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">15. PEP 8: The Stuff Everyone Ignores Until Their PR Gets Rejected</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">PEP stands for <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Overview-of-the-Python-Enhancement-Proposal-PEP-process_fig1_237255044" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Python Enhancement Proposal</a>. There are a bunch of them. PEP 8 is the one that tells you how your code should look, spacing, line length, variable names, etc.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">If you're freelancing or contributing to open source, you will get called out for not following it. Trust me, it’s better to just get used to it early. Use a linter. Save yourself the humiliation of a “can you reformat this?” comment 15 seconds after you open your pull request.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">16. Interpreted Language: You Write It, It Runs</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Python doesn’t need to be compiled. It reads your code line-by-line and runs it on the fly. That’s great for debugging. You can write a little, run it, tweak it, run it again without waiting for a whole build process.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Other interpreted languages? JavaScript, PHP, Ruby.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">The Main Takeaway</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Python doesn’t do a “build step,” it just goes.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">17. Dynamically Typed: Python Trusts You… Maybe Too Much</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Python doesn’t ask you to declare variable types. It guesses.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">x = 5 # cool, it’s an int</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">x = "five" # also cool, now it’s a string</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This makes Python super flexible, but it also means bugs can sneak in like ninjas.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Example</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">"1" + 2 # throws a TypeError in Python</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">But JavaScript? That’ll just give you "12" and call it a day.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">So yeah, Python is strongly typed (doesn’t like mixing types) but also dynamically typed (figures it out at runtime). Great for fast coding. Not so great for catching errors before things break.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">18. What Python Actually Is (No Buzzwords)</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s how I explain Python to new people:</p><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300">It’s a programming language.</li><li class="text-gray-300">You can build almost anything with it, such as web apps, scripts, data pipelines, whatever.</li><li class="text-gray-300">It’s readable as hell. That’s the main reason it’s so popular.</li></ul><h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white">Python Has Batteries Included</h4><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It handles memory for you, supports object-oriented programming, and plays nicely with all kinds of third-party libraries.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">The best part? The community is massive. Whether you're stuck on a bug or trying to build your first side project, you’ll find examples, Stack Overflow answers, or GitHub repos to crib from.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Related Reading</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/cybersecurity-interview-questions" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Cybersecurity Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/leetcode-alternatives" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Leetcode Alternatives</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/system-design-interview-preparation" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">System Design Interview Preparation</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/ansible-interview-questions" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Ansible Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/lockedin" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">LockedIn</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/selenium-interview-questions-and-answers" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Selenium Interview Questions And Answers</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/git-interview-questions" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Git Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/jquery-interview-questions" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">jQuery Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/ml-interview-questions" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">ML Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/nodejs-interview-questions" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">NodeJS Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/aspnet-mvc-interview-questions" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">ASP.NET MVC Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/leetcode-roadmap" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Leetcode Roadmap</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/deep-learning-interview-questions" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Deep Learning Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/devops-interview-questions-and-answers" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">DevOps Interview Questions And Answers</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/front-end-developer-interview-questions" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Front End Developer Interview Questions</a></li><li class="text-gray-300"><a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog/engineering-levels" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Engineering Levels</a></li></ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Nail Coding Interviews with our AI Interview Assistant − Get Your Dream Job Today</h2><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I remember bombing my first technical interview because I blanked on a fundamental sliding window problem. My mind just went silent. That “oh no” spiral? Brutal.

It’s not here to hold your hand. It’s here to quietly sit next to you, see what you’re typing, and whisper the right suggestion at the right time without anyone knowing.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What It Actually Does During Your Interview</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Picture this: you’re mid-coding on CoderPad.

Nope. What actually matters is whether you can tell the difference between a class variable and an instance one, and why your code breaks when it doesn’t behave the way you thought it would. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> keeps it practical.</p><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">It walks through the parts that trip people up: constructors, inheritance, when you should just use composition instead, and those magic methods (__init__, __str__, __eq__) that seem to sneak into every interview just to mess with your head.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Errors, Tests, and Debugging: What Actually Gets You Hired</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">I’ve seen so many candidates write the perfect algorithm… and then choke when the interviewer says: “Cool, what happens if it fails here?” If you’re not testing edge cases or wrapping code in try/except, you’re winging it. I don’t recommend winging it. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> walks through real testing flows not just unittest boilerplate, but where to mock stuff, what exceptions actually make sense, and how to debug without going down a two-hour rabbit hole.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Algorithms, Big O, and That One Recursive Question You Always Miss</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You’re not getting out of a decent interview without talking about time and space complexity. Period. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/blog" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> doesn’t just throw Big O labels at you; it breaks down why it matters and how to tell when your recursion is about to blow the stack. You’ll get help reworking that brute-force recursion into something more innovative (or iterative, if your brain works better that way). Plus, walkthroughs on the usual suspects: binary search, merge sort, memoization, and dynamic programming problems that people love to overcomplicate.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Python Interview Problems: The Real Ones You’ll Get Asked</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">No one’s asking you to build a full-stack app in an interview. But they will ask you to reverse a string, flatten a list, or merge two sorted arrays. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/#pricing" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> gives you multiple ways to solve those not just the clever one-liners, but the “okay, let me write this out so it’s readable” versions too. You’ll see where built-ins make sense (reversed, join, bisect) and when you should write something yourself. Because yes, they’ll ask why you picked one over the other.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Talking Through Code Without Sounding Like a Robot</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">You know what interviewers hate? Code that runs perfectly but is explained like a Wikipedia page. You need to walk through your logic like you’re teaching it to someone competent, not flexing on LeetCode. <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/still_working" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> gives feedback on your explanations, like, Did you actually say why you chose that loop? Did you mention edge cases up front? That kind of stuff separates “yeah, they studied” from “yeah, I’d hire them.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">How I Used Interview Coder in My Own Prep</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Here’s how I used it when prepping for Amazon and Meta: I’d block off 45 minutes, open up the tool, and just grind focused reps, hashing, recursion, binary trees. No distractions, no YouTube in the background. Then I’d switch to mock mode and get real-time coaching on how I explained stuff. That repetition, saying it out loud, catching where I hesitated, that’s what pushed me from “I think I got it” to “I’m ready.”</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">One Last Thing on Ethics</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This tool isn’t about cheating. If that’s your plan, you’ll get exposed in the first real interview. The whole point is to get better, not fake it. Use <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co/signin" target="_self" class="text-white underline decoration-gray-400 underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-gray-600">Interview Coder</a> to figure out what you actually understand and where you're still shaky. It helps you fix those blind spots before someone else points them out in a 45-minute panel interview.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Want to See It in Action?</h3><p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Ask me for something specific. Want to walk through reversing a linked list with and without recursion? Or why using a deque instead of a list changes how your queue works? Or how to write a memoized Fibonacci that doesn’t look like spaghetti? Cool. Let’s pick one and break it down together.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Related Reading</h3><ul class="mb-6 space-y-2 pl-6"><li class="text-gray-300"><a
