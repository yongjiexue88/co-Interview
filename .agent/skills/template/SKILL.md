# Overview
This is a template skill. You can modify this file to enforce specific coding standards, testing protocols, or architectural patterns.

# Instructions
When this skill is active (based on your request or context), I will follow these rules:

1.  **Code Style**: (Add your preferences here, e.g., "Always use async/await instead of .then()")
2.  **Testing**: (Add your preferences here, e.g., "Write unit tests for all new helper functions")
3.  **Documentation**: (Add your preferences here, e.g., "Add JSDoc to every exported function")

# Scripts
You can also add a `scripts/` directory next to this file containing scripts (e.g., specific linters or database helpers) that I can run.
